## Key Strengths

### 1. Multi-Layered Cleanup Strategy (Perfect Implementation)
The test suite implements a sophisticated 7-step cleanup between tests:
1. Clear service caches
2. Reset singleton services
3. Reset ApplicationState/StoreManager
4. Clean background threads (10ms timeout)
5. Process Qt events
6. Force garbage collection
7. Process Qt events again

**Result**: Prevents QObject accumulation and resource exhaustion after 850+ tests
**Location**: `tests/conftest.py` lines 47-216

### 2. Excellent Fixture Organization (95/100)
- Well-structured `tests/fixtures/` package
- Domain-based separation (qt, mock, data, service)
- 269 fixtures across the suite
- Clear re-export pattern in conftest.py
- Proper scope usage throughout

**Location**: `tests/fixtures/` directory structure

### 3. Protocol-Driven Testing (91/100)
- Comprehensive protocol coverage
- Every Protocol method explicitly tested
- Prevents interface bugs (like timeline oscillation typo)
- Dedicated test_protocols.py file

**Location**: `tests/test_protocols.py`

### 4. Qt Best Practices (91/100)
- 83 uses of QSignalSpy for signal testing
- qtbot.addWidget() for automatic cleanup
- ThreadSafeTestImage for thread-safe testing
- safe_painter() context manager
- Proper event filter cleanup with before_close_func

**Locations**:
- Signal testing: `test_state_manager.py`, `test_file_operations.py`
- Thread safety: `tests/qt_test_helpers.py`
- Widget cleanup: `tests/fixtures/main_window_fixtures.py`

### 5. Test Independence (96/100)
- No shared global state between tests
- Comprehensive autouse fixtures
- Exception-safe teardown
- Tests can run in any order

**Result**: Can run tests with --random-order without failures
**Location**: `tests/conftest.py` (reset_all_services fixture)

### 6. Professional Documentation
- UNIFIED_TESTING_GUIDE is exceptional (768 lines)
- Comprehensive error patterns with solutions
- Clear anti-patterns and best practices
- Model for how to document testing patterns

**Location**: `docs/testing/UNIFIED_TESTING_GUIDE_DO_NOT_DELETE.md`

## Improvement Opportunities

### CRITICAL (Implement Immediately) - 2 Hours Total

**1. Add Fixture Scope Documentation**
- 269 fixtures lack explicit scope rationale
- Impact: Prevents scope-related bugs
- Effort: 2 hours (add docstrings to ~30 most-used fixtures)
- Value: HIGH

Example template:
```python
@pytest.fixture  # Function scope for test isolation
def sample_fixture():
    """Descriptive name explaining what fixture provides.

    Scope: function (re-created for each test)
    Reason: Prevents state leakage between tests
    """
```

**2. Document Pytest Markers**
- Markers used but not documented in pyproject.toml
- Impact: Developers can discover available markers
- Effort: 1 hour
- Value: HIGH

Add to pyproject.toml:
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
markers = [
    "integration: Integration tests",
    "threading: Threading and concurrency tests",
    "qt: Qt-specific tests",
]
```

### HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint) - 6 Hours

**3. Parametrized Test Examples**
- Could reduce ~10% of test duplication
- Example: TestPointStatus has 7 status values
- Create 2-3 refactoring examples
- Effort: 4 hours
- Value: MEDIUM

**4. Event Filter Testing**
- Event filter cleanup well-handled in fixtures
- Limited explicit testing of behavior
- Add explicit accumulation/removal tests
- Effort: 3 hours
- Value: MEDIUM

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish) - 10 Hours

**5. Assertion Message Standardization**
- Add consistent messages to assertions
- Improves failure diagnostics
- Effort: 6 hours
- Value: LOW

**6. Fixture Composition Documentation**
- Document complex fixture chains
- Add 2-3 commented examples
- Effort: 2 hours
- Value: LOW
