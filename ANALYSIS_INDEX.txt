Four items marked "Yes" for quick fixes = 7.5 hours total effort

================================================================================
ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

STRENGTHS (7 items):
✓ Service-based architecture with clear separation
✓ Single source of truth (ApplicationState)
✓ Command pattern for undo/redo (well-implemented)
✓ Focused state protocols (FrameProvider, CurveDataProvider, etc.)
✓ Modern Python 3.10+ syntax mostly adopted
✓ Thread-safe ApplicationState with _assert_main_thread()
✓ Good use of Qt signals for cross-component communication

WEAKNESSES (6 items):
✗ 3 God Objects (ApplicationState, InteractionService, MainWindow)
✗ SRP violations: 7+ responsibilities per class, 1000+ LOC
✗ ISP violations: Services expose 30+ methods, clients need 4-5
✗ DIP violations: Services directly import/instantiate each other
✗ Type safety gaps: Local variables missing hints in hot paths
✗ Protocol underutilization: Service layer lacks focused protocols

================================================================================
REFACTORING ROADMAP

WEEK 1 (Quick Wins):
- Add @Slot decorators (0.5h)
- Add local type hints (1.5h)
- Extract FileLoaderProtocol (1h)
- Extract MenuBarFactory (0.75h)
Total: 3.75 hours | Impact: +20 score (62→82)

WEEKS 2-3 (Short-term):
- Refactor ApplicationState (4-6h)
- Extract service protocols (3-4h)
- Improve error handling (3-4h)
Total: 10-14 hours | Impact: +25 score (82→87)
