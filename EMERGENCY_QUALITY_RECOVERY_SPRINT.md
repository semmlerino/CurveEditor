# Emergency Quality Recovery Sprint

## Critical Situation
Multi-agent verification revealed severe code quality degradation requiring immediate intervention before proceeding to Sprint 11.

## Severity Metrics
| Metric | Documented | Actual | Increase | Severity |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Linting Issues** | 54 | 22,424 | 41,000% | CRITICAL |
| **Type Errors** | 424 | 1,148 | 171% | HIGH |
| **Feature Flag Tests** | N/A | 0 | N/A | HIGH |
| **Documentation Currency** | Current | 8 months old | N/A | MEDIUM |

## Sprint Duration
**3 Days** (Using time saved from Sprint 10 completion in 2 days vs 5 planned)

## Day 1: Code Quality Blitz
### Morning (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Run comprehensive auto-fix: `ruff check . --fix`
- [ ] Commit after successful auto-fix
- [ ] Run test suite to catch any regressions
- [ ] Document number of issues auto-fixed

### Afternoon (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Manually review remaining linting issues
- [ ] Fix critical import sorting (I001)
- [ ] Remove unused imports (F401)
- [ ] Clean trailing whitespace (W293)
- [ ] Run test suite after each batch of fixes

### Success Metrics
- Linting issues reduced from 22,424 to <100
- Test pass rate maintained at 82.7%+
- All fixes committed with clear messages

## Day 2: Type Safety Restoration
### Morning (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Fix critical service import errors
- [ ] Resolve "Unknown import symbol" for service getters
- [ ] Fix core data model type annotations
- [ ] Address Transform/ViewState type issues

### Afternoon (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Fix remaining type errors in services/
- [ ] Address type issues in ui/ components
- [ ] Update service_protocols.py with missing types
- [ ] Target: Reduce from 1,148 to <500 errors

### Success Metrics
- Type errors reduced by 50%+
- All service imports properly typed
- Core workflows type-safe

## Day 3: Documentation & Testing
### Morning (2 hours)
- [ ] Update README.md:
  - Add dual architecture explanation
  - Document USE_NEW_SERVICES flag
  - Add migration guide reference
  - Update version history with Sprint 10
  - Add LEGACY deprecation notice

### Afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] Create feature flag test suite:
  ```python
  # Test both architectures
  @pytest.mark.parametrize("use_new_services", [True, False])
  def test_dual_architecture_switching(monkeypatch, use_new_services):
      # Verify architecture switches correctly
  ```
- [ ] Add architecture transition tests
- [ ] Validate migration path
- [ ] Run final quality metrics

### Success Metrics
- Feature flag tests: 100% pass rate
- README.md fully updated
- All Sprint 10 achievements documented

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Commit Frequently**: After each successful phase
2. **Test Continuously**: Run tests after each major change
3. **Rollback Plan**: Git history for quick reversion
4. **Prioritization**: Critical fixes first, cosmetic last

## Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Linting Issues | 22,424 | <100 | CRITICAL |
| Type Errors | 1,148 | <500 | HIGH |
| Feature Flag Tests | 0 | 5+ | HIGH |
| Test Pass Rate | 82.7% | 83%+ | MAINTAIN |
| Documentation | Outdated | Current | MEDIUM |

## Post-Sprint Status
After successful completion:
1. Codebase quality restored to acceptable levels
2. Type safety significantly improved
3. Dual architecture properly tested
4. Documentation current and accurate
5. Ready for Sprint 11: Performance & Polish

## Decision Points
- If auto-fix breaks tests: Selective rollback and manual fixing
- If time runs short: Focus on critical paths, defer cosmetic issues
- If new issues discovered: Document for Sprint 11

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Code quality metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] No regression in test pass rate
- [ ] Feature flag functionality tested
- [ ] Documentation reflects current state
- [ ] Team confidence restored in codebase
