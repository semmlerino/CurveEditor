# Sprint 8: Service Decomposition - Day 1-2 Progress

## Day 1-2 Complete: Service Architecture Foundation ‚úÖ

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Created Protocol Interfaces (4 files)
Clean boundaries between services with well-defined protocols:

**services/protocols/event_protocol.py**
- `EventHandlerProtocol`: Interface for event handling
- `EventResult`: Data class for event processing results
- `ActionType`: Enum for action types (SELECT, DRAG, PAN, ZOOM, etc.)

**services/protocols/selection_protocol.py**
- `SelectionProtocol`: Interface for selection management
- `SelectionState`: Data class for selection state tracking
- Methods for single/multi/rectangle selection

**services/protocols/manipulation_protocol.py**
- `PointManipulationProtocol`: Interface for point operations
- `PointChange`: Data class for tracking changes (undo/redo support)
- `PointOperation`: Enum for operation types (ADD, DELETE, MOVE, etc.)

**services/protocols/history_protocol.py**
- `HistoryProtocol`: Interface for history management
- `HistoryEntry`: Data class for history entries
- `HistoryStats`: Statistics about memory usage

#### 2. Created Service Skeletons (4 files)
Initial implementations with core functionality:

**services/event_handler.py** (250 lines)
- Complete mouse/keyboard/wheel event handling
- Coordinate conversion logic
- Drag/pan state management
- Context menu support

**services/selection_service.py** (200 lines)
- Point finding with tolerance
- Single/multi-selection logic
- Rectangle selection
- Per-view selection state tracking

**services/point_manipulation.py** (300 lines)
- Point position updates with validation
- Add/delete operations
- Nudge and smooth operations
- Frame order maintenance

**services/history_service.py** (340 lines)
- State compression/decompression
- Memory limit enforcement
- Undo/redo stack management
- History statistics

#### 3. Updated Service Registry
Modified `services/__init__.py`:
- Added feature flag: `USE_NEW_SERVICES` environment variable
- Added getter functions for all new services
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Thread-safe singleton initialization

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Feature Flag System
```python
# Enable new services with environment variable
export USE_NEW_SERVICES=true

# Or programmatically
os.environ["USE_NEW_SERVICES"] = "true"
```

#### 2. Gradual Migration Path
- New services work alongside existing God objects
- Can toggle between old/new at runtime
- No breaking changes to existing code

#### 3. Protocol-Based Design
- Each service has a protocol interface
- Enables dependency injection
- Facilitates testing with mocks
- Clear contracts between services

### Code Quality Metrics

| Service | Lines | Methods | Complexity |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|
| EventHandlerService | 250 | 8 | Low |
| SelectionService | 200 | 9 | Low |
| PointManipulationService | 300 | 9 | Medium |
| HistoryService | 340 | 13 | Medium |

All services are under the 400-line target with focused responsibilities.

### Testing Checklist

#### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] test_event_handler.py
- [ ] test_selection_service.py
- [ ] test_point_manipulation.py
- [ ] test_history_service.py

#### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Event ‚Üí Selection flow
- [ ] Selection ‚Üí Manipulation flow
- [ ] Manipulation ‚Üí History flow
- [ ] Complete workflow test

### Next Steps (Day 3)

Tomorrow's focus: **Extract EventHandlerService**
1. Move event handling code from InteractionService
2. Wire up to UI components
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Verify no regression in event handling

### Files Created/Modified

**Created (8 new files):**
- services/protocols/event_protocol.py
- services/protocols/selection_protocol.py
- services/protocols/manipulation_protocol.py
- services/protocols/history_protocol.py
- services/event_handler.py
- services/selection_service.py
- services/point_manipulation.py
- services/history_service.py

**Modified (1 file):**
- services/__init__.py (added new service registration)

### Risk Assessment

‚úÖ **Low Risk Completed:**
- All protocols defined
- Service skeletons created
- Feature flag system working
- No breaking changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Risk Upcoming:**
- Extracting code from God objects
- Wiring services together
- Maintaining state consistency

üî¥ **High Risk Later:**
- Full migration from God objects
- Performance validation
- Production deployment

### Summary

Day 1-2 successfully established the foundation for service decomposition:
- ‚úÖ 4 protocol interfaces defined
- ‚úÖ 4 service skeletons implemented
- ‚úÖ Feature flag system operational
- ‚úÖ All services under 400 lines
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

The architecture is ready for the extraction phase starting Day 3.

**Status**: Day 1-2 COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Progress**: 20% of Sprint 8 (2/10 days)
**Next**: Day 3 - Extract EventHandlerService
**Risk Level**: Low ‚Üí Medium (entering extraction phase)
