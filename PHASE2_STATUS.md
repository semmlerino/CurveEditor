- Automatic button enable/disable based on history state
- No duplicate consecutive entries
- Initial directory added to history on dialog open

**Behavior:**
```
Navigate: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
Current: C, Can go back to B, A
Go back to B
Current: B, Can go back to A, Can go forward to C
Navigate to D
Current: D, Can go back to B, A (forward to C is cleared)
```

**Test Coverage:** 7 tests in `tests/test_image_browser_phase2.py`

**Sort Criteria:**
- **Name:** Alphabetical (case-insensitive)
- **Frame Count:** Number of frames in sequence
- **File Size:** Total size in bytes
- **Date Modified:** Modification time of first frame

**Features:**
- Sort dropdown in sequence list header
- Ascending/descending toggle button (‚Üë/‚Üì)
- Real-time sorting as options change
- Preserves sequence metadata (gaps, warnings)
- Initial state: Name, Ascending

**Implementation Details:**
- Recreates list items to avoid C++ object deletion errors
- Maintains warning icons and tooltips for sequences with gaps
- Efficient sorting even with large sequence lists

**Test Coverage:** 6 tests in `tests/test_image_browser_phase2.py`

---

### 6. State Persistence ‚úÖ NEW
**Implementation:** `_restore_state()` and `_save_state()` in `ui/image_sequence_browser.py:2044-2125`

**Persisted State:**
- Dialog size and position (`image_browser_geometry`)

- Sort criterion (`image_browser_sort`)
- Sort order ascending/descending (`image_browser_sort_ascending`)

**Features:**
- Integration with existing `StateManager` from parent window
- Automatic save on dialog close (both accept and reject)
- Automatic restore on dialog open
- Graceful handling when state manager unavailable
- Uses Qt's `saveGeometry()` and `restoreGeometry()`

**Benefits:**
- Consistent UX across sessions

## üêõ Bug Fixes During Implementation

### 1. Sort Order Icon Mismatch
**Issue:** Initial button showed "‚Üì" but `sort_ascending` was `True`
**Fix:** Changed initial button text to "‚Üë" to match ascending state
**Location:** `ui/image_sequence_browser.py:658`

### 2. QListWidgetItem C++ Object Deletion
**Issue:** Reusing list items caused "Internal C++ object already deleted" errors
**Fix:** Modified `_apply_sort()` to recreate items instead of reusing them
**Location:** `ui/image_sequence_browser.py:2031-2042`

### 3. Missing Initial History Entry
**Issue:** Back button not enabled after first navigation
**Fix:** Added initial directory to navigation history on dialog open
**Location:** `ui/image_sequence_browser.py:442-444`

### 4. BreadcrumbBar Layout Attribute Conflict
**Issue:** `self.layout` conflicted with Qt's built-in `layout()` method
**Fix:** Renamed to `self._layout` to avoid naming collision
**Location:** `ui/image_sequence_browser.py:69`

## üéì Technical Implementation Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Signal/Slot Pattern:** BreadcrumbBar emits `path_changed` signal
2. **History Stack Pattern:** NavigationHistory manages navigation state
3. **Strategy Pattern:** Sort methods based on criterion selection
4. **Observer Pattern:** Real-time search filtering
5. **Memento Pattern:** State persistence with save/restore

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Breadcrumb Creation:** Only creates visible path segments
2. **History Limit:** Caps at 50 entries to prevent memory bloat
3. **Efficient Sorting:** Single-pass sort with custom key functions
4. **Filter Caching:** Reuses filtered results during typing

### Type Safety
- All methods properly type-hinted
- Protocol-based interfaces where appropriate
- No `# type: ignore` comments
- Passes basedpyright strict mode

- Quick search within breadcrumb bar
- Bookmarks/pinned directories system
- Recent directories dropdown menu

- **Multi-criteria sorting** (name, frame count, size, date)
- **Real-time search** (instant filtering)
- **State persistence** (remembers preferences)
- **Comprehensive test coverage** (30/30 tests passing)

The dialog is now significantly more usable, faster to navigate, and matches modern file browser standards. Users will experience a professional-grade browsing interface that respects their preferences and workflow.

**Recommendation:** Deploy to production. Phase 2 is complete and ready for real-world use.
