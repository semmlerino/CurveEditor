# Remaining Tasks for CurveEditor Refactoring

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **MainWindow Refactoring** - Successfully reduced from 817 lines to 240 lines
2. **Replace Print Statements** - Completed for all main application files:
   - config.py ✅
   - signal_connectors/*.py ✅
   - signal_registry.py ✅
   - csv_export.py ✅
   - utils.py ✅
   - timeline_components.py ✅
   - ui_components.py ✅
   - main.py (already using logging) ✅

## 📋 Critical Remaining Tasks

### 1. 🎯 Test Coverage Verification (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Run coverage analysis** to verify >80% coverage
  ```bash
  python3 coverage_analysis.py
  ```
- **Expected outcome**: Coverage report showing percentage for each module
- **Action if <80%**: Add tests for uncovered code, especially:
  - ApplicationState
  - UIInitializer
  - MainWindowOperations
  - MainWindowSmoothing
  - MainWindowDelegator

### 2. 🧪 Integration Testing
- **Manual testing required**:
  - Launch the application
  - Test all major features work correctly
  - Verify delegated operations function properly
  - Check for any UI regressions

### 3. 🔍 Type Checking
- Run mypy on new files:
  ```bash
  mypy main_window.py application_state.py ui_initializer.py main_window_operations.py main_window_delegator.py main_window_smoothing.py
  ```

## 📋 Optional/Low Priority Tasks

### Documentation
- Update architecture docs if major changes needed
- Ensure all new classes have proper docstrings (most already do)

### Code Quality
- Run linting: `ruff .`
- Check for unused imports
- Remove addressed TODO comments

### Performance
- Profile application startup time
- Check memory usage hasn't increased significantly

## 📝 Summary

The main refactoring work is **COMPLETE**:
- ✅ MainWindow reduced to 240 lines (71% reduction!)
- ✅ All print statements replaced with logging in application code
- ✅ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Next critical step**: Run `python3 coverage_analysis.py` to verify test coverage exceeds 80%.

The refactoring has resulted in a much more maintainable codebase with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper logging infrastructure
- Modular architecture
- Easier testing and extension
