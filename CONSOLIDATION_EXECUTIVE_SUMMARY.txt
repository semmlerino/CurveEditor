================================================================================
TOP 5 QUICK WINS (Recommended Starting Points)
================================================================================

QW#1: EXTRACT UNIVERSAL BASECONTROLLER
---------------------------------------
Impact: 9/10 | Time: 2-3 hours | Risk: Very Low | Consistency: 10/10

Consolidate identical __init__ pattern from 8 controllers:

Files to consolidate:
  /ui/controllers/action_handler_controller.py:26-34
  /ui/controllers/point_editor_controller.py
  /ui/controllers/view_camera_controller.py
  /ui/controllers/tracking_selection_controller.py
  /ui/controllers/tracking_display_controller.py
  /ui/controllers/tracking_data_controller.py:44-55
  /ui/controllers/ui_initialization_controller.py
  /ui/controllers/timeline_controller.py

Current pattern (duplicated 8 times):
  def __init__(self, main_window: MainWindowProtocol) -> None:
      super().__init__()
      self.main_window: MainWindowProtocol = main_window
      self._app_state: ApplicationState = get_application_state()

Solution:
  Create /ui/controllers/base_controller.py with BaseController class
  All 8 controllers inherit from it (removes ~80 lines duplicate code)

Expected savings: 80 lines | New controllers: -50% code


QW#2: UNIFY COMMAND ERROR HANDLING
-----------------------------------
Impact: 7/10 | Time: 2-3 hours | Risk: Very Low | Consistency: 9/10

Move _safe_execute() from CurveDataCommand to Command base class

Files affected:
  /core/commands/base_command.py (add unified method)
  /core/commands/curve_commands.py:70-84 (move _safe_execute here)
  /core/commands/insert_track_command.py (use helper)
  + 7 other command files

Current state: 6 different error handling patterns

Solution:
  - Add _execute_safely() to Command base class
  - All 10+ commands use same pattern
  - Standardized logging with stack traces

Expected savings: 40-50 lines | Consistency improvement: 100%


QW#3: PROPERTY DELEGATION MIXIN
-------------------------------
Impact: 8/10 | Time: 1-2 hours | Risk: Very Low | Consistency: 8/10

Consolidate 6 property delegations in MultiPointTrackingController

File:
  /ui/controllers/multi_point_tracking_controller.py:92-99 (and repeats at lines 132-138)

Current pattern (duplicated 6 times):
  @property
  def tracked_data(self) -> dict[str, CurveDataList]:
      return self.data_controller.tracked_data
  
  @tracked_data.setter
  def tracked_data(self, value: dict[str, CurveDataList]) -> None:
      self.data_controller.tracked_data = value

Solution:
  Create _PropertyDelegationMixin that auto-creates delegated properties
  One definition: type(self).tracked_data = self._create_delegated_property(...)

Expected savings: 30+ lines | Reusable pattern: Yes


QW#4: STANDARDIZED CONTROLLER LOGGING
--------------------------------------
Impact: 6/10 | Time: 1-2 hours | Risk: Very Low | Consistency: 9/10

Create ControllerLogger utility for consistent logging patterns

Files affected:
  All 14 controllers (currently use 3-4 different logging patterns)

Solution:
  Create /core/controller_logger.py with ControllerLogger class
  Provides: debug_init(), debug_operation(), warn_failure(), error_operation()
  
Example:
  self._log = ControllerLogger("my_controller")
  self._log.debug_operation("handle_event", target=point_id)

Benefits:
  - All controllers log consistently
  - Easier debugging and error tracing
  - 3-4 logging patterns consolidated to 1


QW#5: MAINWINDOWPROTOCOL PHASE 1 - INTERFACE SEGREGATION
-------------------------------------------------------
Impact: 8/10 | Time: 2-3 hours | Risk: Very Low | Consistency: 7/10

Split bloated 226-line MainWindowProtocol into 6 focused protocols

File:
  /protocols/ui.py:1-226 (80+ members in single protocol)

Current problem:
  - Controllers must support ALL 80+ properties to use MainWindowProtocol
  - Violates Interface Segregation Principle
  - ActionHandlerController only uses 3-5 properties but must declare 80+
  - Makes testing impossible (can't create minimal mock)

Solution:
  Create focused protocols:
    - CurveWidgetAccessProtocol (curve operations)
    - CommandManagerAccessProtocol (undo/redo)
    - TimelineAccessProtocol (frame navigation)
    - TrackingAccessProtocol (multi-point tracking)
    - VisualAccessProtocol (rendering settings)
    - UIStatusAccessProtocol (status updates)
  
  Keep composite MainWindowProtocol for backward compatibility

Expected improvements:
  - Each controller documents exactly what it needs
  - Testing: Can create protocol-specific mocks
  - Maintainability: UI changes don't affect unrelated controllers

================================================================================
MEDIUM-TERM CONSOLIDATIONS (3-4 hours each)
================================================================================

OP#3: UNIFIED SERVICE ACCESS LAYER
----------------------------------
Impact: 9/10 | Time: 3-4 hours | Risk: Low | Architectural: Critical

Problem:
  - ServiceFacade exists but is UNUSED (dead code)
  - 981 direct get_data_service() calls across 127 files
  - Services not mockable for testing
  - No error handling layer

Solution:
  - Promote ServiceFacade as primary service access point
  - All code uses: facade = get_service_facade()
  - Can be migrated file-by-file (not breaking change)

Expected improvements:
  - Centralized service access (all 981 calls through one layer)
  - Test mocking: 1 facade mock vs 4 service mocks
  - Enables service decoration and monitoring


OP#6: UNIFIED STATE ACCESS CONTEXT
---------------------------------
Impact: 7/10 | Time: 3-4 hours | Risk: Very Low | Architectural: High

Problem:
  - 981 direct get_application_state() calls across 127 files
  - State also accessed via StateManager and FrameStore (3 entry points)
  - Violates single source of truth

Solution:
  Create StateContext wrapper:
    from stores import StateContext
    state = StateContext.app_state()
    ui_state = StateContext.ui_state()
    stores = StateContext.stores()
  
  Can be migrated gradually (one file at a time)

Expected improvements:
  - Unified state access (all 981 calls through one layer)
  - Testability: Easy to inject mock state
  - Observability: Central point to track state changes


OP#7: TRANSFORM & COORDINATE SERVICE CONSOLIDATION
--------------------------------------------------
Impact: 7/10 | Time: 5-7 hours | Risk: Low | Specialization

Problem:
  - Two services handle overlapping coordinate concerns
  - TransformService (400+ lines): screen ↔ data, caching
  - CoordinateService (200+ lines): coordinate systems, metadata
  - Both required for coordinate operations

Solution:
  Create unified CoordinateTransformService (600 lines consolidated)
  Manages: transformations, coordinate systems, normalization, caching

Benefits:
  - One service for all coordinate operations
  - Single import instead of two
  - Enables combined transform+normalize operations
