# Import Organization Progress - 2025-05-28 (Continued)

## Files with Fixed Imports

Successfully reorganized imports in the following files according to PEP 8 standards:

### Core Files
1. **main_window.py** ✅
   - Separated standard library, third-party, and local imports
   - Removed duplicate imports
   - Fixed duplicate logger initialization

2. **curve_view.py** ✅
   - Reorganized imports into proper sections
   - Consolidated typing imports

3. **ui_components.py** ✅
   - Fixed mixed import organization
   - Properly separated PySide6 imports from local imports

### UI Components
4. **menu_bar.py** ✅
   - Moved shebang line to top
   - Removed commented-out imports
   - Properly organized all imports

### Services
5. **services/file_service.py** ✅
   - Reorganized imports by category
   - Kept special module loading logic separate

6. **services/curve_service.py** ✅
   - Separated standard, third-party, and local imports
   - Maintained proper order for type checking imports

### Core Components
7. **signal_registry.py** ✅
   - Fixed malformed docstring placement
   - Consolidated all typing imports
   - Removed commented-out and duplicate imports

## Import Organization Standards Applied

All fixed files now follow this pattern:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""Docstring"""

# Standard library imports
import os
from typing import Optional

# Third-party imports
from PySide6.QtCore import Qt
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QWidget

# Local imports
from services.some_service import SomeService
from local_module import LocalClass

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Type checking only imports
```

## Tools Created

1. **analyze_imports.py** - Analyzes import organization issues
2. **fix_imports.py** - Automatically fixes import organization
3. **fix_all_imports.py** - Batch processes multiple files

## Remaining Work

- Run fix_all_imports.py to process remaining files
- Check for circular imports
- Remove any remaining commented imports
- Validate all imports work correctly

## Summary

Import organization is progressing well. The core files and critical services have been fixed. The automated tools are ready to process the remaining files in the project.
