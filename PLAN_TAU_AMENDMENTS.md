# PLAN TAU: AMENDMENTS FROM SECOND-PASS VERIFICATION
## Required Corrections Based on Codebase Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** READY TO APPLY
**Total Effort:** 5-7 hours

---

## SUMMARY

Second-pass verification with four specialized agents identified several areas requiring correction before implementation. These amendments fix count inaccuracies, clarify service patterns, and resolve one circular import.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Architecture and type safety are sound
- ⚠️ Count inaccuracies need correction (frame clamps: 60→5)
- ⚠️ One circular import to fix
- ⚠️ Service lifetime pattern needs clarification
- ⚠️ Documentation-code mismatch needs addressing

---

## AMENDMENT 1: Fix Phase 2.1 Frame Clamping Count

**Location:** `plan_tau/phase2_quick_wins.md` lines 11, 264

**Current (Incorrect):**
```markdown
### **Task 2.1: Frame Clamping Utility**
**Time:** 4 hours
**Impact:** Eliminates 60 duplications
```

**Verified Count:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "frame = max.*min.*frame" ui/ stores/ --include="*.py"
ui/controllers/timeline_controller.py:278
ui/state_manager.py:407
ui/timeline_tabs.py:329
ui/timeline_tabs.py:677
stores/frame_store.py:99

Total: 5 frame-specific clamps (not 60)
```

**Corrected:**
```markdown
### **Task 2.1: Frame Clamping Utility**
**Time:** 4 hours
**Impact:** Eliminates 5 frame clamp duplications + standardizes 30+ other clamp patterns

#### **Scope Clarification:**
- **Frame-specific clamps:** 5 instances (will use new utility)
- **Other clamping patterns:** 30+ (zoom, grid, array indices) - NOT frame-related
- **Manual review needed:** Flag 30+ patterns for context-specific evaluation

**Pattern Distribution:**
- Frame clamps: 5 (timeline_tabs×2, timeline_controller×1, state_manager×1, frame_store×1)
- Zoom clamps: 3
- Grid size clamps: 5
- Widget dimension clamps: 1
- Smoothing window clamps: 1
- Array index clamps: 2
- Other clamping: 15+
```

**Update Success Metrics (line 264):**
```markdown
#### **Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 5 frame clamps use `clamp_frame()` utility
- ✅ 30+ other clamp patterns flagged for review
- ✅ All frame-related tests pass
- ✅ New utility has 100% test coverage
```

**Reasoning:** The plan's regex is intentionally conservative to avoid false positives. The "60 duplications" was an overestimate. Actual frame-specific clamps are 5, with 30+ other clamping patterns that need context-specific evaluation.

## AMENDMENT 2: Fix Phase 3.2 Circular Import

**Location:** `plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md` line 645

**Current (Has Circular Import):**
```python
def handle_mouse_press(self, event, view, main_window) -> bool:
    """Handle mouse press event."""
    from services import get_interaction_service  # ❌ Circular import risk

    result = get_interaction_service().find_point_at(...)
```

**Problem:** MouseInteractionService is part of InteractionService but imports its parent during method execution.

**Corrected:**
```python
def handle_mouse_press(self, event, view, main_window) -> bool:
    """Handle mouse press event.

    Args:
        event: Mouse event
        view: Curve view widget
        main_window: Main window reference

    Returns:
        True if event was handled
    """
    # Store reference to parent's selection service during __init__
    # NOT via circular import during method execution
    result = self._selection_service.find_point_at(
        view, event.pos().x(), event.pos().y(), mode="active"
    )

    if result:
        curve_name, point_index = result
        # Emit signal for selection service
        self.point_clicked.emit(curve_name, point_index, view, main_window)

        # Track drag start
        self._drag_start = event.pos()
        self._dragging_curve = curve_name
        self._dragging_index = point_index
        self.drag_started.emit(event.pos(), curve_name, point_index)
        return True

    return False
```

**Add to MouseInteractionService.__init__:**
```python
def __init__(self, selection_service: "SelectionService") -> None:
    """Initialize mouse interaction service.

    Args:
        selection_service: Reference to selection service for point finding
    """
    super().__init__()
    self._app_state = get_application_state()
    self._selection_service = selection_service  # ✅ Inject dependency
    self._drag_start: QPoint | None = None
    self._dragging_curve: str | None = None
    self._dragging_index: int | None = None
```

**Update InteractionService facade (line 1215):**
```python
def __init__(self) -> None:
    """Initialize interaction service."""
    super().__init__()

    # Create sub-services with proper dependencies
    self.selection_service = SelectionService()
    self.mouse_service = MouseInteractionService(self.selection_service)  # ✅ Inject
    self.command_service = CommandService()
    self.point_service = PointManipulationService()

    # Wire up sub-services
    self._connect_sub_services()
```

---

## AMENDMENT 3: Clarify Service Lifetime Management

**Location:** `plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md` after line 1218

**Add Clarification Section:**

```markdown
#### **Service Lifetime Pattern**

**IMPORTANT:** Sub-services follow the same pattern as existing services in the codebase.

**Existing Pattern (from `services/__init__.py`):**
```python
# All services are singletons created without QObject parent
_data_service: object | None = None

def get_data_service() -> "DataService":
    global _data_service
    with _service_lock:
        if _data_service is None:
            _data_service = DataService()  # ← No parent parameter
    return _data_service
```

**Sub-Service Pattern (Phase 3.2):**
```python
class InteractionService(QObject):
    """Singleton facade - created once, lives for application lifetime.

    Sub-services are also created once and held by the facade.
    No QObject parent needed (services are not QWidget children).
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()  # ← No parent (InteractionService is singleton)

        # Create sub-services - held for application lifetime
        self.mouse_service = MouseInteractionService()  # ✅ No parent needed
        self.selection_service = SelectionService()     # ✅ Singletons via facade
        self.command_service = CommandService()         # ✅ Same pattern as existing
        self.point_service = PointManipulationService()
```

**Why No QObject Parent:**
1. Services are NOT QWidgets (no visual representation)
2. Services are singletons (created once, never destroyed)
3. Existing services in codebase don't use Qt parent/child
4. Services live for application lifetime (no cleanup needed)
5. Qt parent/child is for widget hierarchy, not service containers

**Existing services verified:**
- `DataService()` - no parent
- `TransformService()` - no parent
- `UIService()` - no parent
- All use singleton pattern with global variables

**Sub-services follow the same pattern.**
```

## AMENDMENT 4: Fix Documentation-Code Mismatch (Qt.QueuedConnection)

**Location:** Multiple documentation files

**Files to Update:**

### 1. `TIMELINE_DESYNC_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Current (Lines 11-25):**
Shows code with `Qt.QueuedConnection` parameter that doesn't exist in actual code.

**Action:** Add correction note:
```markdown
### ⚠️ CORRECTION (2025-10-15)

**This document originally claimed Qt.QueuedConnection fixed the desync.**
**That is INCORRECT. The actual fix was synchronous visual updates.**

See `TIMELINE_DESYNC_FIX_SUMMARY.md` for the correct fix (lines 88-135).

**What actually fixed the desync:**
- timeline_tabs.py:665-680 - Synchronous visual update before delegation
- NO Qt.QueuedConnection in actual signal connections
- Comments claiming Qt.QueuedConnection usage are inaccurate
```

### 2. Update Code Comments

**Files to fix:**
- `ui/state_manager.py:69` - Comment claims "subscribers use Qt.QueuedConnection" (FALSE)
- `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:100` - Comment claims "Timeline_tabs uses Qt.QueuedConnection" (FALSE)
- `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:245` - Comment claims direct subscription with Qt.QueuedConnection (FALSE)

**Action:** Replace comments with:
```python
# ui/state_manager.py:69
# Forward ApplicationState signals
# Note: Connections use Qt.AutoConnection (default) - synchronous within thread
_ = self._app_state.frame_changed.connect(self.frame_changed.emit)
```

```python
# ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:100
# Execute synchronously for immediate response
# Timeline_tabs handles desync via synchronous visual updates, not Qt.QueuedConnection
_ = self.main_window.state_manager.frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)
```

### 3. Git Commit Message Correction

**Commit:** `51c500e - "fix(signals): Fix timeline-curve desynchronization with Qt.QueuedConnection"`

**Action:** Cannot amend already-pushed commit, but add correction:

Create `TIMELINE_DESYNC_CORRECTION.md`:
```markdown
# Correction: Timeline Desync Fix

**Original Commit:** `51c500e`
**Original Message:** "fix(signals): Fix timeline-curve desynchronization with Qt.QueuedConnection"

## Correction (2025-10-15)

The commit message and documentation incorrectly attributed the fix to Qt.QueuedConnection.

**What ACTUALLY Fixed the Issue:**
- Synchronous visual updates in timeline_tabs.py (lines 665-680)
- Method `set_current_frame()` updates visual state BEFORE delegating to StateManager
- NO Qt.QueuedConnection parameters in actual code

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "Qt.QueuedConnection" ui/
# Result: 3 matches - ALL IN COMMENTS, NOT CODE
```

**Actual Signal Connections:**
```python
# ui/state_manager.py:72 - No Qt.QueuedConnection
_ = self._app_state.frame_changed.connect(self.frame_changed.emit)

# ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:111 - No Qt.QueuedConnection
_ = self.main_window.state_manager.frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)
```

**Why Documentation Was Wrong:**
- Initial investigation explored Qt.QueuedConnection as potential solution
- Documentation was written during exploration phase
- Actual fix used synchronous updates (simpler, works better)
- Documentation was not updated to reflect actual implementation

**Correct Summary:**
Timeline desync was fixed by ensuring timeline_tabs updates its visual state synchronously
before delegating frame changes to StateManager, NOT by using Qt.QueuedConnection.

See `TIMELINE_DESYNC_FIX_SUMMARY.md:88-135` for accurate description.
```

## AMENDMENT 5: Update Count Metrics in Executive Summary

**Location:** `plan_tau/00_executive_summary.md`

**Current Metrics:**
```markdown
## **Code Reduction:**
- ~3,000 lines of unnecessary code eliminated
- ~1,258 duplications removed  # ← Needs clarification
- ~350 lines of deprecated delegation removed
```

**Updated Metrics:**
```markdown
## **Code Reduction:**
- ~3,000 lines of unnecessary code eliminated
- **Duplications Removed:**
  - 5 frame clamping instances → utility function
  - 18 RuntimeError handlers → @safe_slot decorator
  - 350+ lines of StateManager delegation → direct ApplicationState access
  - 58 transform service getter calls → helper functions
  - 33 active curve access patterns → helper functions
  - **Total reduction: ~1,000 lines** (more focused than originally estimated)
- ~350 lines of deprecated delegation removed (verified)
```

**Rationale:** Original "1,258 duplications" was vague. Breakdown clarifies what's actually being removed with accurate counts verified against codebase.

---

## AMENDMENT 6: Service Pattern Already Matches Codebase

**Location:** NEW FINDING - Positive Verification

**Finding:** Phase 3.2 service creation pattern **ALREADY MATCHES** existing codebase pattern.

**Verification:**
```python
# Existing services (services/__init__.py:96-105)
def get_data_service() -> "DataService":
    global _data_service
    with _service_lock:
        if _data_service is None:
            _data_service = DataService()  # ← No parent, singleton
    return _data_service

# Proposed Phase 3.2 (plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md:1215-1218)
class InteractionService(QObject):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.mouse_service = MouseInteractionService()  # ← Same pattern!
        self.selection_service = SelectionService()
```

**Conclusion:** First review incorrectly flagged service lifetime as an issue. The pattern is CORRECT and matches existing architecture. Only needs clarification (Amendment #3), not changes.

---

## VERIFICATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

Before starting Plan TAU, verify these amendments are applied:

```bash
# 1. Check Phase 2.1 count updated
grep -n "Eliminates 5 frame clamp duplications" plan_tau/phase2_quick_wins.md
# Should find updated text

# 2. Check circular import fixed
grep -n "from services import get_interaction_service" plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md
# Should find ZERO matches in handle_mouse_press method

# 3. Check service lifetime documented
grep -n "Service Lifetime Pattern" plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md
# Should find clarification section

# 4. Check documentation corrections
test -f TIMELINE_DESYNC_CORRECTION.md
# Should exist

# 5. Verify baselines are correct
echo "Frame clamps: $(grep -rn 'frame = max.*min.*frame' ui/ stores/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
echo "RuntimeError: $(grep -rn 'except RuntimeError' ui/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
echo "hasattr: $(grep -r 'hasattr(' ui/ services/ core/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
# Should match: 5, 18, 43
```
