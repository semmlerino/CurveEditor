## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (Will Definitely Break)

1. **Sub-controller properties undefined** (Task 1)
   - Tests directly access `controller.display_controller`
   - 50+ lines of test code at risk
   - Recommendation: Preserve properties

2. **API methods not mapped** (Task 1)
   - 37 public methods at risk
   - No explicit preservation list
   - Recommendation: Create detailed checklist

3. **Signal consolidation undefined** (Task 1)
   - 4 signals with no consolidation strategy
   - Internal connections at risk
   - Recommendation: Preserve all signals

4. **ViewManagementController property removal** (Task 2)
   - MainWindow directly accesses this property
   - 4 call sites will break (lines 301, 554, 560, 1077)
   - Recommendation: Create backward-compat alias

5. **Property preservation undefined** (Task 2)
   - image_filenames, current_image_idx, etc. at risk
   - MainWindow uses getattr() for safety but still fragile
   - Recommendation: Preserve all properties

### Risk Metrics

- **Overall Risk**: HIGH (before mitigation) → LOW (after mitigation)
- **Test Failure Probability**: HIGH (8+ tests will fail without mitigation)
- **MainWindow Failure Probability**: HIGH (4+ call sites will break without mitigation)
- **Service Integration Risk**: MEDIUM (dependencies unclear)
- **Mitigation Effort**: LOW (4-6 hours of planning saves 8-15 hours of debugging)

### Timeline Impact

- **Original Estimate**: 12 hours (from PHASE_2_PLAN.md)
- **Planning Overhead**: +4-6 hours (recommended)
- **Testing Overhead**: +1-2 hours (recommended)
- **New Total**: 17-20 hours
- **Without Mitigation**: +8-15 hours debugging (could be 25-35 hours)

## Recommendation

### DO NOT PROCEED without addressing critical issues

1. **Create explicit API preservation checklists** (2 hours)
   - Document all 37 methods for Task 1
   - Document all 34 methods for Task 2
   - Mark each as: preserve, remove, or rename

2. **Document signal consolidation strategy** (1 hour)
   - Decide: preserve all 4 signals? (recommended: YES)
   - Document: internal signal connections will be maintained

3. **Plan backward-compatibility** (1 hour)
   - Create aliases for MainWindow properties
   - Document test update strategy
   - Plan rollback points for each task

4. **Get team consensus** (1 hour discussion)
   - Share analysis documents
   - Discuss recommendations
   - Agree on approach

5. **Proceed with implementation** (12-15 hours)
   - Follow detailed API checklist
   - Preserve all identified items
   - Test after each consolidation
   - Update documentation
