# Sprint 8: Service Decomposition - Day 7 Complete ✅

## Day 7: Extract FileIOService and ImageSequenceService - COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Extracted File I/O Operations from DataService
Successfully extracted all file handling functionality into FileIOService:

**FileIOService (394 lines):**
- JSON loading and saving with multiple format support
- CSV loading and saving with optional headers
- Recent files management
- Last directory tracking
- Path security validation
- Thread-safe operations

#### 2. Extracted Image Sequence Management from DataService  
Successfully extracted all image handling functionality into ImageSequenceService:

**ImageSequenceService (356 lines):**
- Image sequence loading from directories
- Frame number extraction and sorting
- LRU cache management
- Frame-based image navigation
- Multiple image format support (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff, .tif)
- Thread-safe caching

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Clean Separation of Concerns
```python
# FileIOService handles data persistence
file_io_service.save_json(path, curve_data)
file_io_service.load_csv(path)

# ImageSequenceService handles image management
image_service.load_image_sequence(directory)
image_service.set_current_image_by_frame(view, frame)
```

#### 2. Security-First Design
```python
# All paths validated before use
validated_path = validate_file_path(file_path, operation_type="data_files")
validated_dir = validate_directory_path(directory, allow_create=False)
```

#### 3. Flexible Format Support
```python
# JSON supports multiple structures
{"curve_data": [...]}  # Standard format
{"points": [...]}       # Alternative format
[...]                   # Direct list format

# Points can be tuples or dicts
{"frame": 1, "x": 10, "y": 20, "status": "interpolated"}
```

### Code Quality Metrics

| Service | Lines | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| FileIOService | 394 | 8 | ✅ Under 400 |
| ImageSequenceService | 356 | 9 | ✅ Under 400 |
| **Total Extracted** | **750** | **17** | **✅ Success** |

### Test Coverage

**FileIOService Tests:**
- ✅ JSON save/load with metadata
- ✅ CSV save/load with headers
- ✅ Recent files management
- ✅ Last directory tracking
- ✅ Multiple JSON format support
- ✅ CSV without headers
- ✅ Clear recent files
- ✅ Backward compatibility

**ImageSequenceService Tests:**
- ✅ Supported format checking
- ✅ Image sequence loading
- ✅ Frame number sorting
- ✅ Closest frame finding
- ✅ LRU cache eviction
- ✅ Cache information
- ✅ Cache clearing
- ✅ Frame-based navigation
- ✅ Backward compatibility

### Performance Features

#### FileIOService
- Thread-safe with RLock
- Efficient path validation
- Minimal memory footprint for recent files

#### ImageSequenceService
- LRU cache for loaded images
- Configurable cache size
- Smart frame number extraction
- Efficient sorting algorithms

### Files Created

**Created (4 files):**
- services/file_io_service.py (394 lines)
- services/image_sequence_service.py (356 lines)
- test_file_io_extraction.py (test script)
- test_image_sequence_extraction.py (test script)

### DataService Reduction

**Original DataService**: 1,152 lines

**After Day 7 Extraction**:
- FileIOService took ~400 lines of logic
- ImageSequenceService took ~350 lines of logic
- **Estimated Remaining**: ~400 lines

**Still to Extract (Day 9)**:
- CacheService (general caching)
- RecentFilesService (if more needed)
- Remaining analysis methods

### Risk Assessment

✅ **Completed Successfully:**
- Both services under 400-line limit
- All functionality preserved
- Full test coverage
- No breaking changes

⚠️ **Minor Observations:**
- Path security adds some complexity
- Cache management could be further optimized
- Some duplication between services (could share cache logic)

### Next Steps (Day 8-9)

**Day 8**: Buffer day (if needed) or start Day 9 work

**Day 9**: Extract remaining services from DataService
- CacheService for general data caching
- RecentFilesService if more abstraction needed
- Clean up remaining DataService code

### Summary

Day 7 successfully extracted two major services from DataService:
- ✅ **FileIOService**: 394 lines (JSON/CSV/recent files)
- ✅ **ImageSequenceService**: 356 lines (image management/caching)
- ✅ **750 lines total** extracted from DataService
- ✅ All 17 tests passing
- ✅ Both services under 400-line limit

This brings us to **6 services extracted** from the two God objects, with excellent progress on decomposing DataService.

---

**Status**: Day 7 COMPLETE ✅  
**Progress**: 70% of Sprint 8 (7/10 days)  
**Services Extracted**: 6 of 10 planned  
**Next**: Day 8 (buffer) or Day 9 (CacheService + cleanup)  
**Risk Level**: Low (pattern proven, nearing completion)
