## ‚ùå When NOT to Use Agents

**Use direct tools for simple tasks** - agents add overhead:

- **Reading specific files** ‚Üí Use Read tool directly
- **Finding files by pattern** ‚Üí Use Glob tool directly
- **Searching code in 1-3 files** ‚Üí Use Read tool directly
- **Quick grep/search** ‚Üí Use Grep tool directly

**Use agents for:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Analysis requiring expertise
- Code generation/modification
- Debugging mysterious issues

## Single Agent Tasks

**Common Agents:**
```text
python-code-reviewer          # Review code for bugs, style, design issues
type-system-expert           # Add/fix type annotations, resolve type errors
test-development-master      # Write tests, TDD, coverage analysis
deep-debugger               # Investigate mysterious/complex bugs
threading-debugger          # Fix deadlocks, race conditions, threading bugs
performance-profiler        # Find bottlenecks, optimize performance
code-refactoring-expert     # Improve code structure, remove duplication
python-expert-architect     # Design architecture, async/concurrency patterns
python-implementation-specialist  # Implement features, write code
qt-concurrency-architect    # Qt threading, signals/slots across threads
qt-ui-modernizer           # Modernize Qt UI/UX
qt-modelview-painter       # Custom Qt widgets, Model/View patterns
ui-ux-validator            # Validate Qt UI for usability/accessibility
venv-keeper                # Manage venv, dependencies, ruff, basedpyright
```

**Specialized Agents:**

## Parallel Patterns (60% Faster!)

**Default to parallel when tasks are independent** - saves 50-70% time:

```text
# Code analysis (60% faster than sequential)
"Use python-code-reviewer and type-system-expert in parallel to analyze [file]"

# Complete audit (3-5x faster)
"Use python-code-reviewer, type-system-expert, performance-profiler in parallel to audit [module]"

# Qt review (parallel = 2x faster)
"Use qt-concurrency-architect and ui-ux-validator in parallel to review [Qt app]"
```

**When to use parallel:**
- ‚úÖ Tasks don't depend on each other's output
- ‚úÖ Analyzing same code from different perspectives
- ‚úÖ Multiple verification/validation steps

**When to use sequential:**
- ‚õî Agent 2 needs Agent 1's findings
- ‚õî Implementation depends on design
- ‚õî Fix depends on debug analysis

## Python 3.13+ Quick Wins

**User Prompts:**
```text
# TypeIs (better than TypeGuard)
"Use type-system-expert to replace TypeGuard with TypeIs in [module]"

# ReadOnly TypedDict
"Use type-system-expert to add ReadOnly to immutable TypedDict fields in [config]"

# Pytest 8.4+ async fixtures
"Use test-development-master to fix async fixture deprecation warnings"

# Full modernization
"Modernize for Python 3.13+: type-system-expert updates types, test-development-master fixes async fixtures, venv-keeper updates tools"
```

## Pro Tips

‚úÖ **Be specific**: Include file/module names and exact requirements
‚úÖ **Default to parallel**: Run independent agents together - saves 60% time
‚úÖ **Chain logically**: Feed output from one agent to the next explicitly
‚úÖ **Include context**: "Based on [agent1] findings, use [agent2] to..."
‚úÖ **Verify changes**: Always run tests after modifications
‚úÖ **Choose right agent**: Qt issues need Qt agents, not general Python agents
‚úÖ **Provide file paths**: "ui/main_window.py" not "the main file"

‚ùå **Avoid vague prompts**: "Fix the code" ‚Üí Which file? Which agent?
‚ùå **Don't skip verification**: Changes without tests = risky
‚ùå **Don't mix concerns**: Use specialized agents for specialized tasks
‚ùå **Don't use agents for simple reads**: Use Read/Glob tools for file operations

## Emergency Commands

**User Prompts:**
```text
# Critical bug in production
"Use deep-debugger to analyze [production bug], python-implementation-specialist to hotfix, test-development-master to add regression test"

# Performance crisis
"Use performance-profiler to identify critical bottlenecks in [slow component]"

# Type errors blocking deployment
"Use type-system-expert to fix all basedpyright errors in [module] immediately"

# Tests failing before release
