| test_sprint8_services_basic.py | 27 | ✅ All passing |
| **Total** | **38 tests** | **Fixed** |

## Time Investment
- Quick Win 1: 30 minutes
- Quick Win 2: 15 minutes
- Quick Win 3: 30 minutes
- **Total**: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Next Steps

### Remaining Quick Wins
4. Fix 20-30 more integration tests
5. Add coverage to data_service.py
6. Update CLAUDE.md with Sprint 9 learnings

### High-Value Targets
Based on the failures, focus on:
- `test_sprint8_history_service.py` - Multiple failures
- `test_history_service.py` - History-related issues
- `test_input_service.py` - Input handling tests

## Key Learnings
1. **Many test failures are simple issues** - Wrong attribute names, missing methods
2. **Tests need maintenance** - When services change, tests must be updated
3. **Quick fixes have high impact** - 38 tests fixed in 75 minutes
4. **CI/CD setup is straightforward** - GitHub Actions easy to configure

## Recommendation
Continue with quick wins - we're making excellent progress. At this rate, we could fix 100+ tests today and reach 400+ passing tests (82%+ pass rate).
