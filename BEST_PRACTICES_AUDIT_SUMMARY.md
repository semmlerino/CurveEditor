# Best Practices Audit Summary: ELIMINATE_COORDINATOR_PLAN.md

**Status**: CRITICAL VIOLATIONS FOUND - DO NOT PROCEED
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Severity**: High - Plan would introduce new bugs

---

## Quick Summary

The ELIMINATE_COORDINATOR_PLAN.md misdiagnoses the root cause and proposes a solution that violates Qt best practices. Instead of fixing the real issue (connection type), it would:

1. **Remove safety mechanisms** (coordinator) that prevent race conditions
2. **Introduce memory leaks** by connecting to singleton without cleanup
3. **Reduce code quality** by using feature flags for signal architecture
4. **Violate Qt patterns** by relying on Python `__del__` instead of Qt lifecycle

---

## Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. MISDIAGNOSIS: QueuedConnection Isn't the Problem

**Claim**: Plan says `Qt.QueuedConnection` causes issues
**Reality**: `QueuedConnection` is actually correct here. It prevents nested signal execution.
**Real Issue**: Using it to DEFER execution instead of for synchronization
**Fix**: Remove `QueuedConnection` from connection type, keep coordinator

```python
# CURRENT (wrong reason for QueuedConnection)
connect(handler, Qt.QueuedConnection)  # Defers to next event loop (WRONG!)

# CORRECT (keep coordinator, use DirectConnection)
connect(handler)  # Default AutoConnection → DirectConnection (same thread)
```

---

### 2. RACE CONDITIONS: Removing Coordinator Breaks Synchronization

**Claim**: "Each component independently reactive, no race conditions"
**Reality**: Multiple components connecting to same signal with DirectConnection = non-deterministic order

**Scenario**:
- Component A processes frame 42
- Component B processes frame 42
- Order undefined → state inconsistency → visual desync

**Fix**: Keep coordinator to enforce deterministic order

---

### 3. MEMORY LEAKS: Singleton ApplicationState Keeps Widgets Alive

**Problem**:
- Widget connects to ApplicationState (singleton)
- Widget destroyed, but signal connection remains
- ApplicationState keeps widget alive via slot reference
- Memory leak until app terminates

**Current Code Issue**:
```python
self._app_state.curves_changed.connect(self._on_app_state_curves_changed)
# ^^^ No cleanup tracking
# When this object destroyed, connection still in ApplicationState
```

**Fix**: Use Qt's `destroyed` signal, not Python `__del__`

---

### 4. FEATURE FLAG ANTI-PATTERN: False Test Safety

**Problem**:
- Phases 1-5 use `USE_DIRECT_FRAME_CONNECTION` flag
- Both paths execute during testing (flag=True)
- Only direct path executes in production
- Code exercised in tests that won't run in production

**Fix**: Complete migration without feature flags. One test pass → delete old code → done.

---

### 5. INCOMPLETE CLEANUP: signalConnectionManager.__del__ Fragile

**Problem**:
```python
def __del__(self) -> None:
    """Disconnect signals"""
    # ❌ Not guaranteed to run immediately
    # ❌ Qt objects may already be destroyed
    # ❌ Relies on reference counting (CPython-specific)
```

**Fix**: Use Qt's `destroyed` signal (guaranteed timing)

---

## What SHOULD Happen Instead

### Correct Approach (Qt Compliant):

1. **Fix the Connection Type** (5 min)
   - Remove `Qt.QueuedConnection` from coordinator
   - Use default `AutoConnection` (becomes `DirectConnection` same-thread)
   - Execution is synchronous, deterministic, ordered

2. **Remove Signal Forwarding** (30 min)
   - Delete `StateManager.frame_changed.emit` forwarding
   - All components connect directly to `ApplicationState`
   - Simpler debugging, clearer signal flow

3. **Implement Atomic Data Capture** (1 hour)
   - Snapshot state AT signal receipt
   - Use snapshot for all phases
   - Never re-read properties during handler execution

4. **Unify Memory Management** (1 hour)
   - Use `SignalManager` for ALL connections
   - Implement cleanup via `destroyed` signal
   - Remove reliance on `__del__`

5. **Use Modern Qt6 Patterns** (30 min)
   - Named parameters: `type=Qt.ConnectionType.DirectConnection`
   - Add `@Slot` decorators
   - Use context managers for scoped connections

6. **Comprehensive Testing** (1 hour)
   - Verify execution order
   - Verify no duplicate updates
   - Verify no memory leaks
   - Test under rapid frame scrubbing

## Key Violations at a Glance

| Violation | Severity | Current | Best Practice |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Misunderstands Qt signal types | CRITICAL | QueuedConnection blamed | Remove connection type arg |
| Race conditions from dual paths | HIGH | Feature flags maintain both | Complete migration, no flags |
| Memory leaks from singleton | HIGH | No cleanup tracking | Qt `destroyed` signal |
| Signal forwarding indirection | MEDIUM | StateManager forwards | Direct ApplicationState |
| Inadequate state capture | MEDIUM | Re-reads during exec | Snapshot at receipt |
| Relies on `__del__` cleanup | MEDIUM | Python GC unreliable | Qt object lifetime |
| Missing Qt6 patterns | LOW | Positional args | Named parameters, `@Slot` |

## Files Affected

- `ELIMINATE_COORDINATOR_PLAN.md` - Overall strategy (FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED)
- `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py` - Connection type issue (KEEP, FIX)
- `ui/state_manager.py` - Signal forwarding (REMOVE)
- `ui/curve_view_widget.py` - Memory leak risk (FIX CLEANUP)
- `ui/controllers/signal_connection_manager.py` - `__del__` fragility (FIX)
- `tests/test_frame_change_coordinator.py` - Inadequate coverage (EXPAND)

---

## Recommendation

**REJECT THIS PLAN** and implement the corrected approach instead.

The coordinator pattern is GOOD and should be kept. The only issue is the connection TYPE. By fixing that one thing, all problems disappear:

- Execution becomes deterministic ✓
- Race conditions prevented ✓
- Tests and production aligned ✓
- Qt best practices followed ✓

**Estimated Correct Time**: 4-6 hours for complete, tested solution
**Risk Level**: Low (smaller change, better tested)
**Quality**: High (uses proven Qt patterns)
