## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Before Phase 2.2)

### Issue 1: Secondary Layer Violation in Phase 2.2
- **Problem**: Proposed `calculate_fit_bounds()` imports `MAX_ZOOM_FACTOR`, `MIN_ZOOM_FACTOR` from `ui.ui_constants`
- **Impact**: Creates NEW layer violation while trying to fix existing ones
- **Fix**: Move zoom constants to `core/defaults.py` in Phase 1.2
- **File**: REFACTORING_PLAN.md Task 2.2, line 532
- **Effort**: 10 minutes
- **Blocks**: Phase 2.2 execution

### Issue 2: Incomplete Constant Migration in Phase 1.2
- **Problem**: Plan misses `DEFAULT_STATUS_TIMEOUT` (in `services/ui_service.py`)
- **Impact**: Architectural separation incomplete
- **Fix**: Add to Phase 1.2 grep search, move to `core/defaults.py`
- **File**: REFACTORING_PLAN.md Task 1.2
- **Effort**: 15 minutes
- **Blocks**: Phase 1 commit quality

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Before Phase 2)

### Issue 3: Undocumented Assumptions in Phase 1.4 Helper
- **Problem**: `_find_point_index_at_frame()` helper lacks documentation of point tuple structure and ordering
- **Impact**: Future developers won't understand WHY linear search is used
- **Fix**: Enhanced docstring with explicit assumptions and examples
- **Effort**: 10 minutes

### Issue 4: Scope Verification Needed for Phase 2.1
- **Problem**: Need to verify actual count of old `state.active_curve` pattern
- **Impact**: Ensures accurate effort estimation
- **Fix**: Count occurrences before execution
- **Effort**: 5 minutes per location found

---

## 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### Issue 5: Spinbox Duplication Scope Claim
- **Problem**: Claims 16 lines duplicated (2x8) but actual is 8 lines (1 location)
- **Impact**: Documentation accuracy
- **Fix**: Update Task 1.3 scope documentation
- **Effort**: 5 minutes

---

## ✅ VALIDATED - FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICES

### Phase 1.1: Dead Code Removal
- ✅ Verification procedures thorough
- ✅ YAGNI principle correctly applied
- ✅ Confidence: 95%

### Phase 1.3: Spinbox Helper
- ✅ Correct DRY principle
- ✅ Modern Qt signal blocking pattern
- ✅ Clear naming: `_update_spinboxes_silently()`
- ✅ Confidence: 95%

### Phase 2.1: active_curve_data Property
- ✅✅ EXCELLENT use of walrus operator `:=`
- ✅ Outstanding documentation (old vs new pattern)
- ✅ Type-safe contract: `tuple[str, CurveDataList] | None`
- ✅ 50% code reduction (4 lines → 2 lines)
- ✅ Confidence: 95%

---

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS

### Before Phase 1 Execution
1. ✅ Review REFACTORING_PLAN.md - no changes needed
2. ✅ Verify grep verification step - looks good
3. ✅ Rollback procedures clear - good

### Before Phase 1.2 Completion
1. **FIX**: Add `DEFAULT_STATUS_TIMEOUT` to core/defaults.py (Issue #2)
2. **FIX**: Add zoom constants to core/defaults.py (Issue #1 part 1)
3. **ADD**: Update Phase 1.2 grep to catch all constants

### Before Phase 2 Execution
1. **VERIFY**: Count old `state.active_curve` pattern (Issue #4)
2. **FIX**: Update Phase 2.2 proposed code to import from core/defaults (Issue #1 part 3)
3. **ENHANCE**: Add docstring to `_find_point_index_at_frame()` (Issue #3)

### Before Phase 3 Decision
1. Stabilize Phase 1-2 for 2-3 weeks
2. Assess MainWindow complexity
3. Schedule Phase 3 if still beneficial

## 🧪 Test Coverage Assessment

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ✅ | Comprehensive, well-organized |
| Type Checking | ✅ | basedpyright integration solid |
| Integration Tests | ⚠️ | Exists but limited for new helpers |
| Manual Tests | ✅ | Thorough smoke test checklist |

## 🎯 Execution Confidence Levels

| Phase | Confidence | Can Proceed? | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **1.1** | 95% | ✅ YES | Dead code removal, low risk |
| **1.2** | 85% | ✅ YES | After fixing Issues #1 & #2 |
| **1.3** | 95% | ✅ YES | Spinbox helper, proven pattern |
| **1.4** | 90% | ✅ YES | After documenting (Issue #3) |
| **2.1** | 90% | ✅ YES | After scope verification (Issue #4) |

| **3** | 50% | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | Requires 2-3 week stabilization |

---

## 📝 Key Recommendations

### DO
- ✅ Proceed with Phase 1 immediately (low risk, high value)
- ✅ Keep Phase 2.1 property pattern - it's excellent
- ✅ Maintain comprehensive test procedures
- ✅ Document assumptions in helper methods
- ✅ Schedule Phase 3 only after stabilization

### DON'T
- ❌ Skip verification steps (grep checks are critical)
- ❌ Execute Phase 2.2 before fixing layer violation
- ❌ Rush Phase 3 (high risk requires analysis)
- ❌ Add UI imports to service layer
- ❌ Use magic tuple indices without documentation
