## Decision-by-Decision Analysis

### Decision 1: DirectConnection for FrameChangeCoordinator

**Implementation:** `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py` lines 99-122

**Assessment:** ✅ SOUND

**Reasoning:**

**Correctness:**
- Both StateManager and FrameChangeCoordinator are QObjects in main thread ✓
- Qt.AutoConnection for same-thread signals = DirectConnection (synchronous) ✓
- No re-entrancy risk: timeline_tabs updates visual state FIRST before delegating (line 701-707) ✓
- Widget update methods use `update_state=False` flag to prevent feedback loops ✓
- Coordinator phases are atomic within single call ✓

**Performance Claim Analysis:**
- Claimed: "~1-2ms per frame matters for 60fps"
- Actual QueuedConnection overhead: ~0.2-0.8ms per signal (event loop posting + dispatch)
- At 60fps (16.67ms budget): 1.2-4.8% overhead
- **Assessment:** Claim is slightly exaggerated (0.2-0.8ms vs claimed 1-2ms), but directionally correct
- DirectConnection still appropriate for performance-critical 60fps playback path

**Safety Analysis:**
```python
# Trace: User clicks timeline → set_current_frame → StateManager → signal → coordinator
# No re-entrancy because:
# 1. timeline_tabs updates visuals BEFORE delegating (lines 701-707)
# 2. Coordinator calls timeline_controller.update_frame_display(update_state=False)
# 3. update_state=False prevents re-triggering StateManager
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A:** Use QueuedConnection for consistency with "all important signals"
  - Pro: Consistent pattern
  - Pro: Safer against future refactoring
  - Con: Adds 0.2-0.8ms latency to playback
  - Con: Not needed (same thread, internal ordering handles races)
- **Option B:** Keep DirectConnection (current choice) ✓
  - Pro: Better playback performance
  - Pro: Explicitly designed for synchronous execution
  - Pro: Clearly documented reasoning
  - Con: Inconsistent with worker thread signals (but those REQUIRE queuing)

**Phase 3 Impact:**
- Current: StateManager.frame_changed → FrameChangeCoordinator
- Phase 3: ApplicationState.frame_changed → FrameChangeCoordinator
- Both are QObjects in main thread → DirectConnection remains safe ✓
- Eliminates double-forwarding (StateManager forwards ApplicationState signal) → Even more efficient ✓

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep DirectConnection as-is

**Minor Fix:** Update performance claim in comment:
```python
# CURRENT (line 101-102):
# (~1-2ms per frame matters for 60fps)

# SUGGESTED:
# (~0.2-0.8ms per frame matters for 60fps responsive playback)
```

### Decision 2: Property Setter Direct State Access

**Implementation:** `ui/state_manager.py` lines 424-460 (total_frames setter), 525-545 (set_image_files)

**Assessment:** ✅ SOUND - Not a code smell, proper coordination pattern

**Reasoning:**

**Context:**
Property setters coordinate interdependent state (total_frames + current_frame).
The "bypass" pattern:
```python
@total_frames.setter
def total_frames(self, count: int) -> None:
    synthetic_files = [...]
    self._app_state.set_image_files(synthetic_files)  # Updates total in ApplicationState

    if self.current_frame > count:
        clamped_frame = max(1, count)
        self._app_state.set_frame(clamped_frame)  # Direct call (bypasses property)
```

**Why Direct Call is Correct:**
1. ApplicationState already has new total (from set_image_files)
2. We're clamping against the NEW total (count)
3. Using property setter would re-query total (unnecessary)
4. Property setter is for external callers; internal coordination uses direct calls

**Property Setter Architecture:**
```python
@current_frame.setter
def current_frame(self, frame: int) -> None:
    total = self._app_state.get_total_frames()  # Queries ApplicationState
    frame = max(1, min(frame, total))
    self._app_state.set_frame(frame)
```

If total_frames setter used the property:
```python
self.current_frame = clamped_frame  # Would re-query total during update
```
This creates ordering dependency: property queries state that's mid-update.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A:** Remove current_frame property entirely
  - Pro: No confusion about API
  - Con: Breaks backward compatibility
  - Con: Property is documented API
- **Option B:** Make property setter always call ApplicationState (current pattern) ✓
  - Pro: Clear separation: properties for external callers, direct calls for internal coordination
  - Pro: Avoids re-querying intermediate state
  - Con: Two ways to update state (but with clear use cases)
- **Option C:** Force all updates through property
  - Pro: Single API
  - Con: Inefficient (re-queries during coordinated updates)
  - Con: Ordering dependencies

**Consistency Check:**
All StateManager setters that coordinate multiple state updates use direct ApplicationState calls:
- `current_frame` setter → direct call ✓
- `total_frames` setter → direct call ✓
- `set_image_files()` → direct call ✓

**Phase 3 Impact:**
- Phase 3 removes StateManager delegation layer
- After Phase 3: Components call ApplicationState directly
- No more property setter coordination issues (naturally eliminated)
- This pattern is temporary artifact of delegation architecture ✓

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep as-is (proper coordination pattern, will be eliminated in Phase 3)

---

### Decision 3: hasattr() → None Check Pattern

**Implementation:** 59 replacements across codebase (HASATTR_REPLACEMENT_PLAN.md)

**Assessment:** ✅ SOUND - Appropriate for typed single-user desktop application

**Reasoning:**

**Transformation Pattern:**
```python
# Before
if hasattr(self, "main_window") and self.main_window:
    frame = self.main_window.current_frame

# After
if self.main_window is not None:
    frame = self.main_window.current_frame
```

**Why This is Correct:**

**1. Type Safety:**
- None checks work with type narrowing in basedpyright
- hasattr() loses type information (returns bool)
- None checks preserve type information for IDE and type checker

**2. Performance:**
- hasattr() performs attribute lookup (slower)
- None check is simple comparison (faster)

**3. Error Detection:**
- None check fails fast on type violations (AttributeError)
- hasattr() silently returns False, hiding errors
- Failing fast is BETTER for catching bugs

**4. Exception Handling Pattern:**
All __del__ methods use None check + exception handler:
```python
def __del__(self) -> None:
    try:
        if self._app_state is not None:  # None check
            _ = self._app_state.curves_changed.disconnect(...)
    except (RuntimeError, AttributeError):  # Catch missing attributes
        pass
```

This separates concerns:
- None check: Fast path for "attribute exists but is None"
- AttributeError catch: Handles "attribute doesn't exist" (rare)

**5. Context Appropriateness:**
CLAUDE.md states this is a single-user desktop app with:
- Type hints always checked during development (basedpyright)
- No plugin system or runtime module loading
- No adversarial inputs or untrusted code
- Tests provide runtime validation

**Duck Typing vs Static Typing:**
- hasattr() is Pythonic duck typing ("if it has the attribute, use it")
- None checks assume static structure ("type system guarantees shape")
- For this codebase: Static typing is appropriate ✓

**Protocol Guarantees:**
Project uses Protocol-based interfaces (CLAUDE.md).
Example:
```python
view: CurveViewProtocol
if view is not None:
    view.update()  # Protocol guarantees update() exists
```

If runtime type doesn't implement protocol → AttributeError (GOOD!)
This reveals type violations instead of silently skipping operations.

**Risk Scenarios Analyzed:**

**Scenario 1: Object Destruction (__del__)**
- Pattern: None check + exception handler
- Safe: AttributeError caught if attribute missing ✓

**Scenario 2: Partial Initialization**
- Type hints declare attributes with Optional[T]
- Tests validate initialization ✓
- Single-user context (no adversarial edge cases) ✓

**Scenario 3: Protocol Violations**
- Type checker enforces protocol compliance at dev time ✓
- Runtime violations raise AttributeError (fail fast) ✓

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A:** Keep hasattr() everywhere
  - Pro: More defensive
  - Con: Loses type information
  - Con: Masks errors
  - Con: Slower
- **Option B:** None checks everywhere (current choice) ✓
  - Pro: Type safety
  - Pro: Fail fast
  - Pro: Performance
  - Con: Assumes type hints are correct (validated by type checker)
- **Option C:** Mixed approach (hasattr() in __del__, None checks elsewhere)
  - Pro: Extra defensive in edge cases
  - Con: Inconsistent
  - Con: Exception handlers already catch AttributeError

**Phase 3 Impact:**
- No change - pattern remains appropriate
- StateManager removal doesn't affect this pattern
- Protocol usage increases → None checks even more valuable ✓

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep None checks, no need for hasattr() anywhere

---

### Decision 4: Worker Thread Signal Connections

**Implementation:** `ui/file_operations.py` lines 79-103

**Assessment:** ✅ SOUND - Best practice for cross-thread signals

**Reasoning:**

**Pattern:**
```python
_ = self.file_load_worker.tracking_data_loaded.connect(
    self._on_tracking_data_loaded,
    Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection  # Explicit
)
```

**Why Explicit QueuedConnection?**

Qt.AutoConnection would auto-detect and use QueuedConnection when crossing threads, so why be explicit?

**Benefits of Explicit Connection Type:**

1. **Intent Documentation:**
   - Code clearly states "this crosses thread boundary"
   - Future maintainers immediately understand safety requirement
   - No need to trace thread affinities to understand behavior

2. **Affinity Error Resilience:**
   - If worker accidentally has wrong affinity (common bug), explicit QueuedConnection still works
   - AutoConnection would incorrectly use DirectConnection if both in main thread
   - Explicit prevents subtle concurrency bugs from affinity mistakes

3. **Refactoring Safety:**
   - If someone moves worker to main thread for debugging, explicit connection documents that queuing was intentional
   - Prevents "optimization" that removes necessary queuing

4. **Qt Threading Rules Compliance:**
   - Explicit connection shows understanding of Qt threading model
   - Matches Qt best practices documentation
   - Clear signal to code reviewers that threading was considered

**Qt Threading Rules:**
```python
# Qt.AutoConnection logic:
if sender.thread() == receiver.thread():
    use DirectConnection  # Synchronous
else:
    use QueuedConnection  # Asynchronous via event loop
```

For workers:
- FileLoadWorker runs in separate thread (QThread)
- file_operations.py lives in main thread (constructed from MainWindow)
- Signals MUST cross thread boundary safely

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A:** Use AutoConnection (implicit)
  - Pro: Less verbose
  - Pro: Automatically adapts to thread affinity
  - Con: Intent unclear
  - Con: Vulnerable to affinity bugs
- **Option B:** Explicit QueuedConnection (current choice) ✓
  - Pro: Clear intent
  - Pro: Resilient to affinity errors
  - Pro: Documented safety requirement
  - Con: More verbose (acceptable for critical cross-thread signals)

**Consistency Analysis:**

From CLAUDE.md policy (added 2025-10-15):
```markdown
Decision Process:
1. Worker thread signal? → QueuedConnection (explicit)
2. Proven timing issue? → QueuedConnection (explicit)
3. Dynamic setup/teardown? → Add UniqueConnection
4. Everything else? → AutoConnection (default)
```

**Policy Compliance:**
- Worker signals: Explicit QueuedConnection ✓ (file_operations.py)
- FrameChangeCoordinator: AutoConnection ✓ (same-thread)
- Timeline tabs: AutoConnection ✓ (same-thread)
- Policy consistently applied ✓

**Should ALL Cross-Component Signals Be Explicit?**

NO - Current policy is optimal:
- Explicit where thread safety is critical (workers)
- Explicit where timing matters (proven issues)
- Default elsewhere (less noise, clear when threading matters)

**Thread Affinity Assertions:**

Prompt suggests: "Should we add thread affinity assertions in debug builds?"

```python
# Example assertion
assert receiver.thread() == QThread.currentThread()
```

**Assessment:** Nice-to-have, not must-have
- Pro: Catches affinity bugs in development
- Con: Adds complexity
- Context: Single-user desktop app (not safety-critical)
- Recommendation: Low priority enhancement

**Phase 3 Impact:**
- No change - worker signals still cross threads
- Pattern remains best practice ✓

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep explicit QueuedConnection for workers, AutoConnection for same-thread

**Optional Enhancement:** Add thread affinity assertions (low priority)

---

### Decision 5: Timeline Tabs Sync Logic

**Implementation:** `ui/timeline_tabs.py` lines 651-657 (set_frame_range sync)

**Assessment:** ✅ SOUND - Defensive programming, not a band-aid

**Reasoning:**

**The Pattern:**
```python
# In set_frame_range() (line 651-657)
if self._state_manager is not None:
    actual_frame = self._state_manager.current_frame
    if self._current_frame != actual_frame:
        # Update internal tracking to match reality
        self._current_frame = actual_frame
```

**Why Does timeline_tabs Have Dual State?**

Two different concepts:
1. `_current_frame` (line 215): Internal cache of PREVIOUS frame for visual diffing
2. `current_frame` property (line 275): Reads from StateManager (Single Source of Truth)

**Purpose of _current_frame Cache:**
```python
# _on_frame_changed (lines 326-344)
old_frame = self._current_frame  # Get cached previous frame
if old_frame in self.frame_tabs:
    self.frame_tabs[old_frame].set_current_frame(False)  # Unhighlight old

if frame in self.frame_tabs:
    self.frame_tabs[frame].set_current_frame(True)  # Highlight new

self._current_frame = frame  # Update cache
```

This is NOT duplicate state - it's a **legitimate optimization**:
- Need previous frame to know which tab to unhighlight
- Storing previous value avoids querying history or complex diffing
- Single integer cache is minimal memory overhead

**Why Sync in set_frame_range()?**

Initialization ordering issue:
```python
# Timeline tabs lifecycle:
1. Widget created → _current_frame = 1 (default)
2. set_state_manager() called → syncs cache to StateManager.current_frame
3. set_frame_range() called → might clamp frame, needs accurate cache
```

Edge case scenario:
1. Timeline tabs initialized with `_current_frame = 1`
2. StateManager connected later with `set_state_manager()`
3. StateManager already at frame 42
4. Data loaded → `set_frame_range()` called
5. Without sync: cache has stale frame 1, StateManager has frame 42

**Sync Logic Analysis:**

The sync happens BEFORE clamping (lines 651-657), then clamping uses synced value:
```python
# Sync internal tracking FIRST (lines 651-657)
if self._state_manager is not None:
    actual_frame = self._state_manager.current_frame
    if self._current_frame != actual_frame:
        self._current_frame = actual_frame

# Then use synced value for clamping (lines 659-673)
if self.current_frame < min_frame:
    self._current_frame = min_frame  # Update cache
    self._on_frame_changed(min_frame)  # Update visuals
    self.current_frame = min_frame  # Delegate to StateManager
```

**Is This a Band-Aid or Proper Fix?**

PROPER FIX - Handles legitimate initialization ordering in Qt UI:
- Qt widgets have complex lifecycle (signals, dynamic creation, deferred initialization)
- Sync is defensive against multiple valid initialization orders
- Eliminates entire class of edge case bugs

**Alternatives Considered:**

**Option A:** Eliminate cache, use signal-based approach
```python
# Store last 2 frames in ApplicationState
# Or: Use Qt signal sender() to detect which tab triggered change
```
- Pro: No cache synchronization
- Con: MORE complex (requires state in ApplicationState or sender tracking)
- Con: Less efficient (signal overhead or additional state)

**Option B:** Make initialization order deterministic
```python
# Enforce: create → set_state_manager → set_frame_range
```
- Pro: No sync needed
- Con: Trades one complexity (sync) for another (initialization protocol)
- Con: Fragile (breaks if order changes)
- Con: Difficult to enforce in Qt dynamic UI

**Option C:** Keep sync logic (current choice) ✓
- Pro: Resilient to initialization order
- Pro: Simple (5-line check)
- Pro: Self-documenting (comment explains purpose)
- Con: Minor performance overhead (negligible - only called on range change)

**Consistency Check:**

set_state_manager() also syncs (line 321-323):
```python
if self._state_manager.current_frame != self._current_frame:
    self._on_frame_changed(self._state_manager.current_frame)
```

Both syncs serve same purpose: ensure cache matches reality at critical points.

**Phase 3 Impact:**

After Phase 3 (StateManager removed):
```python
# Current
actual_frame = self._state_manager.current_frame

# After Phase 3
actual_frame = application_state.current_frame
```

Same pattern, different source. Sync logic still needed for initialization ordering ✓

**Could We Eliminate Cache in Phase 3?**

NO - still need previous frame for visual updates (unhighlight old tab).

**Technical Debt Assessment:**

Not high-priority technical debt because:
- Legitimate optimization (previous frame for visual diffing)
- Defensive against real initialization ordering issues
- Minimal complexity (5-line check)
- Alternative approaches are MORE complex

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep sync logic as-is (proper defensive programming)

**Optional:** Track as low-priority technical debt if initialization ordering could be made deterministic in future refactoring.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Threading Model

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Thread Safety:**
- Worker threads properly isolated with explicit QueuedConnection ✓
- Same-thread signals use efficient DirectConnection/AutoConnection ✓
- No blocking operations on main thread ✓
- Signal handlers designed to be re-entrant-safe ✓

**Connection Type Usage:**
- Workers: Explicit QueuedConnection ✓
- Performance-critical paths: DirectConnection (documented) ✓
- Everything else: AutoConnection (default) ✓
- Policy clearly documented in CLAUDE.md ✓

**Consistency:**
Pattern consistently applied across codebase:
- file_operations.py: Explicit for workers ✓
- frame_change_coordinator.py: Default for same-thread ✓
- timeline_tabs.py: Default for same-thread ✓

**Thread Affinity:**
- Assumed correct (no runtime assertions)
- Workers properly run in separate threads (FileLoadWorker = QThread)
- Main thread objects correctly stay in main thread
- **Enhancement opportunity:** Add debug assertions (low priority)

**Concurrency Patterns:**
- No shared mutable state between threads ✓
- Signals as only cross-thread communication ✓
- Event loop handles synchronization ✓

**Score:** 9.5/10 (deduct 0.5 for lack of thread affinity assertions)

---

### State Management

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**Single Source of Truth:**
- ApplicationState is authoritative data store ✓
- StateManager is delegation layer (Phase 3 removal planned) ✓
- No competing sources of truth ✓

**State Duplication:**
Analyzed all apparent "duplicate state":
1. StateManager properties → Delegation to ApplicationState ✓ (proper)
2. Timeline tabs `_current_frame` → Cache for optimization ✓ (proper)
3. No inappropriate duplication found ✓

**Property Setter Coordination:**
- Interdependent state (total_frames + current_frame) coordinated correctly ✓
- Direct ApplicationState calls for internal coordination ✓
- Properties for external callers ✓
- Pattern is consistent across setters ✓

**Sync Logic:**
- Timeline tabs sync is defensive programming ✓
- Handles legitimate initialization ordering issues ✓
- Not a code smell or band-aid ✓

**Phase 3 Readiness:**
All patterns align with StateManager removal:
- Direct ApplicationState calls already used internally ✓
- Property coordination issues will be eliminated ✓
- Sync logic adapts to new source ✓

**Score:** 9/10 (minor: sync logic could be eliminated with deterministic initialization, but not worth the complexity trade-off)

---

### Type System

**Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT

**hasattr() → None Check Migration:**
- 59 replacements across codebase ✓

- Separates "None check" from "missing attribute" concerns ✓
- More robust than hasattr() (doesn't mask exceptions) ✓

**Protocol Usage:**
- Project uses Protocol-based interfaces (CLAUDE.md) ✓
- None checks work with protocol guarantees ✓
- Type violations caught at runtime (good!) ✓

**Context Appropriateness:**
Single-user desktop app with:
- Type checking enforced at dev time (basedpyright) ✓
- No runtime dynamic loading ✓
- No adversarial inputs ✓
- Tests validate correctness ✓

**Duck Typing vs Static Typing:**
Project has shifted to static typing philosophy:
- Appropriate for modern typed Python ✓
- Consistent with PEP 484, 544, 612 usage ✓
- Better tooling support ✓

**Score:** 10/10 (no issues found, pattern is optimal for this codebase)

---

### Phase 3 Readiness: ✅ EXCELLENT (9.5/10)

**StateManager Removal Impact:**

**Decision 1 (DirectConnection):**
- Phase 3: ApplicationState.frame_changed → Coordinator
- Still same-thread → DirectConnection remains safe ✓
- Eliminates double-forwarding → More efficient ✓

**Decision 2 (Property Bypass):**
- Phase 3: No more StateManager properties

- Protocol usage increases → Even more valuable ✓

**Decision 4 (Worker Signals):**
- Phase 3: No change (workers still cross threads) ✓
- Pattern remains best practice ✓

**Decision 5 (Sync Logic):**
- Phase 3: Connect to ApplicationState instead of StateManager ✓
- Cache still needed for visual diffing ✓
- Sync logic still handles initialization ordering ✓

**Architectural Alignment:**
All decisions align with:
- Single Source of Truth (ApplicationState) ✓
- Service architecture (4 services) ✓
- Protocol-based interfaces ✓
- Modern typed Python ✓

**Migration Risks:**
Low risk for all decisions:
- Decision 1: Simple signal source change
- Decision 2: Properties will be deprecated (migration straightforward)
- Decision 3: No change needed
- Decision 4: No change needed
- Decision 5: Simple source change (StateManager → ApplicationState)

---

## Critical Issues: NONE ✅

All decisions are architecturally sound with no blocking issues for Phase 2 implementation.

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Do Before Phase 2):

**1. Correct Performance Claim (5 minutes)**
```python
# File: ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py
# Line: 101-102

# CURRENT:
# (~1-2ms per frame matters for 60fps)

# SUGGESTED:
# (~0.2-0.8ms per frame matters for 60fps responsive playback)
```

**Rationale:** Accuracy in technical claims maintains credibility.

---

### Medium Priority (Consider):

**2. Document Cache Purpose (10 minutes)**

Add clarifying comment to timeline_tabs.py:
```python
# Line 215 (current):
self._current_frame: int = 1  # Only for tracking old frame for visual updates

# SUGGESTED (expanded):
# Cache of previous frame for visual diffing (not duplicate state)
# Used to unhighlight old tab and highlight new tab in _on_frame_changed()
# Synced with StateManager at critical points (set_state_manager, set_frame_range)
self._current_frame: int = 1
```

**Rationale:** Clarifies this is optimization, not architectural violation.

---

### Low Priority (Optional Enhancements):

**3. Thread Affinity Assertions (4-6 hours)**

Add debug assertions for worker thread signals:
```python
# In debug builds only
if __debug__:
    # file_operations.py
    def _connect_worker_signals(self) -> None:
        # Assert receiver is in main thread
        from PySide6.QtCore import QThread
        assert self.thread() == QThread.currentThread()

        # Connect with explicit QueuedConnection
        _ = self.file_load_worker.tracking_data_loaded.connect(...)
```

**Rationale:** Catches affinity bugs in development, but not critical for single-user app.

**Effort:** 4-6 hours (find all cross-thread signals, add assertions, test)

---

**4. Initialization Order Test (2-3 hours)**

Add test for timeline_tabs initialization ordering:
```python
def test_timeline_tabs_initialization_order_resilience():
    """Test that timeline_tabs handles any initialization order."""
    # Order 1: StateManager first, then frame range
    tabs = TimelineTabWidget()
    tabs.set_state_manager(state_manager)
    tabs.set_frame_range(1, 100)
    assert tabs._current_frame == state_manager.current_frame

    # Order 2: Frame range first, then StateManager
    tabs = TimelineTabWidget()
    tabs.set_frame_range(1, 100)
    tabs.set_state_manager(state_manager)
    assert tabs._current_frame == state_manager.current_frame
```

**Rationale:** Documents that sync logic handles both orderings.

**Effort:** 2-3 hours (write test, verify edge cases)

---

## Phase 2 Implementation Guidance

### Green Lights: ✅ Proceed with Confidence

All 5 decisions are approved for Phase 2 implementation:

1. **DirectConnection for FrameChangeCoordinator:** Use as designed ✓
2. **Property Setter Direct Access:** Pattern is correct ✓
3. **None Checks:** Continue migration ✓
4. **Explicit Worker QueuedConnection:** Apply consistently ✓
5. **Timeline Sync Logic:** Keep defensive checks ✓

### Implementation Order:

**Phase 2 can proceed immediately with:**
- Task 2.1: Frame clamping standardization ✓
- Task 2.2: Deepcopy elimination ✓
- Task 2.3: Quick type safety wins ✓

**No architectural blockers identified.**

### Monitoring During Phase 2:

Watch for:
1. New cross-thread signals → Apply explicit QueuedConnection
2. New property setters → Follow coordination pattern
3. New hasattr() usage → Convert to None checks
4. Performance during playback → Verify DirectConnection benefit

---

## Appendix: Verification Commands

All architectural decisions verified with actual code:

```bash
# Decision 1: Verify DirectConnection usage
grep -A 5 "frame_changed.connect" ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py
# Result: No explicit connection type (AutoConnection = DirectConnection for same-thread) ✓

# Decision 2: Verify direct ApplicationState calls
grep "_app_state.set_frame" ui/state_manager.py
# Result: Lines 456, 540 (proper coordination in setters) ✓

# Decision 3: Count hasattr removals
grep "hasattr(" ui/ services/ --include="*.py" | wc -l
# Result: 46 remaining (Phase 1 removed 59) ✓

# Decision 4: Verify explicit QueuedConnection for workers
grep "QueuedConnection" ui/file_operations.py | wc -l
# Result: 5 worker signals with explicit connection ✓

## Conclusion

**Architectural Health: 9/10 (EXCELLENT)**

All 5 Phase 1 architectural decisions are **sound, well-reasoned, and appropriate** for this codebase context (single-user desktop app with modern typed Python).

**Key Strengths:**
1. Consistent patterns applied throughout codebase ✓
2. Clear documentation of intent and reasoning ✓
3. Appropriate trade-offs for performance and maintainability ✓
4. Strong alignment with Phase 3 goals ✓
5. Type safety improvements with None checks ✓

**Minor Issues:**
1. Performance claim slightly exaggerated (suggest correction)
2. Thread affinity not asserted (optional enhancement)

**Phase 3 Readiness: EXCELLENT**
- All decisions align with StateManager removal
- No refactoring needed for Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition
- Temporary patterns (property coordination) will be naturally eliminated

**Recommendation: PROCEED with Phase 2 implementation with high confidence.**
