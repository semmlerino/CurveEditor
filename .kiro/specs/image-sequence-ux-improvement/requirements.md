# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current "Load Image Sequence" functionality in CurveEditor, while comprehensive in features, presents usability challenges that make it feel clunky and unintuitive for users. This feature improvement aims to streamline the image sequence loading experience by addressing key user experience pain points while maintaining the existing powerful functionality.

## Glossary

- **CurveEditor**: The main application for editing animation curves and tracking data
- **Image Sequence Browser**: The dialog window used to browse and select image sequences for loading
- **Image Sequence**: A series of numbered image files (e.g., render_0001.exr, render_0002.exr) used as background reference
- **Thumbnail Preview**: Small preview images showing the content of image files
- **Quick Access**: Fast navigation to commonly used directories
- **User Workflow**: The sequence of actions a user performs to accomplish a task

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VFX artist, I want to quickly load image sequences without navigating through complex UI elements, so that I can focus on my creative work rather than fighting with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Load Image Sequence dialog, THE CurveEditor SHALL display the most recently used directory by default
2. WHEN the user selects a directory containing image sequences, THE CurveEditor SHALL automatically detect and display all sequences within 2 seconds
3. WHEN multiple sequences are found, THE CurveEditor SHALL sort them by name in ascending order by default
4. WHEN the user double-clicks on a sequence, THE CurveEditor SHALL immediately load the sequence and close the dialog
5. WHERE the user has previously loaded sequences, THE CurveEditor SHALL provide quick access to recent directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pipeline TD, I want the image sequence browser to remember my preferred locations and settings, so that I can maintain consistent workflows across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds a directory to favorites, THE CurveEditor SHALL persist this preference across application sessions
2. WHEN the user changes sort preferences, THE CurveEditor SHALL remember these settings for future sessions
3. WHEN the user navigates to a new directory, THE CurveEditor SHALL add it to the recent directories list
4. WHILE the favorites list contains more than 10 entries, THE CurveEditor SHALL allow users to organize or remove entries
5. WHERE the user works on multiple projects, THE CurveEditor SHALL maintain separate recent directory lists per project context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compositor, I want immediate visual feedback about image sequences, so that I can quickly identify the correct sequence without guessing from filenames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a sequence, THE CurveEditor SHALL display thumbnail previews within 1 second
2. WHEN thumbnails are loading, THE CurveEditor SHALL show a progress indicator with cancel option
3. WHEN a sequence has missing frames, THE CurveEditor SHALL clearly indicate gaps in the frame range
4. WHEN displaying sequence metadata, THE CurveEditor SHALL show resolution, frame count, and file size information
5. WHERE sequences have different resolutions or formats, THE CurveEditor SHALL visually distinguish them in the list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the interface to guide me through the loading process, so that I can successfully load sequences without extensive training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dialog opens with no sequences found, THE CurveEditor SHALL display helpful guidance text explaining how to navigate to image sequences
2. WHEN the user hovers over interface elements, THE CurveEditor SHALL provide informative tooltips explaining their purpose
3. WHEN the user makes an invalid selection, THE CurveEditor SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHILE the user navigates the interface, THE CurveEditor SHALL maintain logical keyboard tab order for accessibility
5. WHERE the user needs help, THE CurveEditor SHALL provide contextual help or documentation links

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a power user, I want efficient keyboard shortcuts and batch operations, so that I can work quickly without relying on mouse interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+L, THE CurveEditor SHALL focus the address bar for direct path entry
2. WHEN the user presses F5, THE CurveEditor SHALL refresh the current directory contents
3. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+F, THE CurveEditor SHALL focus the sequence filter for quick searching
4. WHEN the user presses Enter on a selected sequence, THE CurveEditor SHALL load the sequence immediately
5. WHERE the user navigates with arrow keys, THE CurveEditor SHALL provide smooth keyboard-only navigation through all interface elements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a technical artist, I want the browser to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I can work with various file naming conventions and directory structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning directories with thousands of files, THE CurveEditor SHALL remain responsive and provide progress feedback
2. WHEN encountering permission errors, THE CurveEditor SHALL display user-friendly error messages and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN sequences have non-standard naming patterns, THE CurveEditor SHALL still detect them using flexible pattern matching
4. IF network drives are slow to respond, THEN THE CurveEditor SHALL provide timeout handling with retry options
5. WHERE file paths contain special characters or Unicode, THE CurveEditor SHALL handle them correctly without errors
