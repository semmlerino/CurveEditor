# Sprint 9 Handoff Checklist

## For Next Developer/Sprint Lead

### Quick Start Commands ‚ö°
```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
python -m pytest tests/

# Check types (use wrapper!)
./bpr

# Test with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=services --cov-report=html

# Run application
python main.py
```

### Essential Documentation üìö
- [ ] Read `TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDE.md` - Type system overview
- [ ] Read `TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Testing patterns
- [ ] Read `SPRINT_9_COMPLETE.md` - Sprint summary
- [ ] Read `SPRINT_9_RETROSPECTIVE.md` - Lessons learned
- [ ] Review `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines

### Current State Assessment ‚úÖ

#### Test Suite Status
- **Total Tests**: 487
- **Passing**: 364 (75%)
- **Failing**: 123 (25%)
- **Coverage**: 30% overall, 23% Sprint 8 services

#### Type Safety Status  
- **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Type Errors**: 1,225 (mostly false positives)
- **Production Typed**: ~40%
- **Test Code Typed**: Minimal (low priority)

#### Critical Files Modified
- `core/typing_extensions.py` - Type aliases
- `services/protocols/base_protocols.py` - Protocols
- `basedpyrightconfig.json` - Type config
- `tests/test_sprint8_*.py` - New test files

### Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### High Priority
1. **123 failing tests** - Integration tests broken by Sprint 8
2. **Low service coverage** - Many services <20% covered
3. **No CI/CD** - Tests not automated

#### Medium Priority
1. **Type noise** - 8,140 warnings from PySide6
2. **Test fixtures outdated** - Need updates for new architecture
3. **Mock complexity** - Tests use complex mocking

#### Low Priority
1. **Test code types** - 950+ errors in tests
2. **Documentation gaps** - Some services undocumented
3. **Performance tests** - No benchmarks exist

### Recommended Next Steps üéØ

#### Sprint 10 Priorities
1. [ ] Fix critical failing tests (focus on integration tests)
2. [ ] Set up CI/CD with coverage gates
3. [ ] Improve service coverage to 50%
4. [ ] Update test fixtures for new architecture
5. [ ] Add type checking to CI/CD pipeline

#### Quick Wins Available
- Fix `test_threading_safety.py` - Simple mock issues
- Add coverage to `data_service.py` - Critical service
- Type `services/ui_service.py` - High impact
- Document service interfaces - Help future devs

### Development Environment üîß

#### Required Tools
- Python 3.12
- PySide6 6.4.0
- pytest 8.4.1
- basedpyright 1.31.1
- ruff (for linting)

#### Virtual Environment
```bash
# Location
./venv

# Key packages
PySide6==6.4.0
pytest==8.4.1
pytest-cov==6.2.1
pytest-qt==4.4.0
PySide6-stubs==6.7.3.0
```

#### Configuration Files
- `basedpyrightconfig.json` - Type checking
- `pyproject.toml` - Project config
- `.coverage` - Coverage settings
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant guide

### Testing Checklist ‚úì

Before making changes:
- [ ] Run existing tests: `pytest tests/`
- [ ] Check coverage: `pytest --cov=.`
- [ ] Run type check: `./bpr`
- [ ] Review failing tests list

After making changes:
- [ ] Run affected tests
- [ ] Update broken tests
- [ ] Add new tests for new code
- [ ] Check coverage didn't decrease
- [ ] Run type check on changed files

### Common Gotchas ü™§

1. **Don't use basedpyright directly** - Use `./bpr` wrapper
2. **Set QT_QPA_PLATFORM** - Required for headless testing
3. **Test decay is real** - Update tests during refactoring
4. **Type annotation paradox** - More types = more errors initially
5. **Qt widget patterns** - Create many false positives

### Communication Channels üì¢

- Sprint reports in root directory
- Progress tracked in `*_COMPLETE.md` files
- Issues logged in retrospectives
- Test results in terminal output

### Handoff Validation ‚úÖ

Verify you can:
- [ ] Run the application
- [ ] Execute test suite
- [ ] Run type checker with `./bpr`
- [ ] Generate coverage report
- [ ] Access all documentation

### Contact for Questions

If you need clarification on:
- **Type system**: See TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDE.md
- **Testing patterns**: See TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- **Sprint decisions**: See SPRINT_9_RETROSPECTIVE.md
- **Project structure**: See CLAUDE.md

### Final Notes

Sprint 9 established critical infrastructure but didn't achieve all goals. The foundation is solid but needs continued investment. Focus on incremental improvements rather than perfection.

Key principle learned: **"Good enough beats perfect when perfect never ships."**

### Sign-off

- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Tests running
- [ ] Type checker working
- [ ] Coverage baseline understood
- [ ] Known issues acknowledged
- [ ] Next steps clear
