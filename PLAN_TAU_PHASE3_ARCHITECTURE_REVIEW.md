# PLAN TAU Phase 3 Architecture Review
**Python Expert Architect Assessment**

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 represent **excellent architectural refactoring** that successfully eliminates god objects while maintaining clean architecture patterns. Both tasks demonstrate advanced Python pattern usage, strong SOLID compliance, and professional Qt-specific design.

**Grade: A-** (Excellent with minor improvements recommended)

**Ready for Task 3.3:** YES (with recommended improvements implemented)

**Technical Debt Reduced:** YES (significant reduction from god objects to focused components)

---

## 1. Pattern Usage Quality

### 1.1 Protocol Pattern (Task 3.1)

**Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

**PEP 544 Compliance:**
- ✅ All protocols correctly inherit from `Protocol` base class
- ✅ Protocol methods use `...` (not `pass`)
- ✅ Runtime imports avoided via `TYPE_CHECKING`
- ✅ Protocols marked with `@runtime_checkable` decorator
- ✅ Clear docstrings explain protocol purpose

**Example of correct usage:**
```python
@runtime_checkable
class MainWindowProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for MainWindow interface used by controllers."""

    @property
    def curve_widget(self) -> CurveViewProtocol | None:
        """Access to curve view widget."""
        ...
```

**Protocol Minimalism (Interface Segregation):**

**ISSUE FOUND: ActionHandlerProtocol is too large**
- Contains 30+ methods (lines 15-109 in controller_protocols.py)
- Violates Interface Segregation Principle
- Mixes multiple concerns (file operations, zoom, smooth, undo/redo)
- **Recommendation:** Split into focused protocols:
  - `FileOperationProtocol` (new/open/save/export)
  - `ViewOperationProtocol` (zoom/pan/reset)
  - `EditOperationProtocol` (undo/redo/smooth/filter)

**Protocol Usage Consistency:**
- ✅ Controllers correctly use protocols instead of concrete types
- ✅ Type annotations preserved throughout
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with MainWindow

**Score: 8/10** (excellent implementation, deduction for oversized protocol)

---

### 1.2 Facade Pattern (Task 3.1)

**Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

**Facade Correctness:**
- ✅ Creates 3 specialized sub-controllers in `__init__`
- ✅ Delegates all public methods to appropriate sub-controllers
- ✅ Minimal business logic (just coordination)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility perfectly
- ✅ Clean property delegation for `tracked_data` and `point_tracking_directions`

**Example of clean delegation:**
```python
def on_tracking_data_loaded(self, data):
    """Handle single tracking trajectory loaded (delegates to data controller)."""
    self.data_controller.on_tracking_data_loaded(data)
```

**Signal-Based Coordination:**
```python
def _connect_sub_controllers(self) -> None:
    """Wire up sub-controller signals for coordination."""
    # Data loaded → Display updates
    self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(
        self.display_controller.on_data_loaded,
        Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection,
    )
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Loose coupling via signals (no direct method calls between controllers)
- ✅ Explicit `QueuedConnection` for thread safety documentation
- ✅ Signal connections in dedicated method (`_connect_sub_controllers`)
- ✅ Recursion protection via `_handling_signal` flag

**Minor Issue: Small amounts of logic in facade methods**

Example from `on_tracking_direction_changed` (lines 158-166):
```python
def on_tracking_direction_changed(self, point_name: str, new_direction: object) -> None:
    self.data_controller.on_tracking_direction_changed(point_name, new_direction)
    # Also trigger display updates
    self.display_controller.update_tracking_panel()
    # Force repaint to update colors immediately if active curve
    if self.main_window.active_timeline_point == point_name:
        if self.main_window.curve_widget:
            self.main_window.curve_widget.update()
```

**Assessment:** This is acceptable coordination logic (not business logic). The facade needs to orchestrate the cross-cutting concern of keeping display in sync with data changes.

**Line Count Reduction:**
- Original: 1,065 lines (god object)
- Facade: 347 lines (67% reduction)
- Total (3 controllers + facade): 1,391 lines (31% increase for clarity/docs)

**Score: 9/10** (excellent facade implementation)

---

### 1.3 Owner Pattern (Task 3.2)

**Implementation Quality: OUTSTANDING**

**Internal Helper Classes (Lines 67-860):**

All 4 helper classes follow owner pattern perfectly:

1. **_MouseHandler** (lines 67-336)
2. **_SelectionManager** (lines 338-593)
3. **_CommandHistory** (lines 595-858)
4. **_PointManipulator** (lines 860-1072)

**Owner Pattern Correctness:**

✅ **Helpers are NOT QObjects** (lightweight composition)
```python
class _MouseHandler:
    """Internal helper for mouse/keyboard event handling.

    NOT a QObject - lightweight helper class owned by InteractionService.
    """
```

✅ **Helpers prefixed with `_`** (internal implementation detail)

✅ **Helpers hold `self._owner` reference**
```python
def __init__(self, owner: "InteractionService") -> None:
    """Initialize with reference to owner service for state access."""
    self._owner = owner
    self._app_state = get_application_state()
```

✅ **Helpers access shared state via owner**
```python
# Access owner's spatial index
idx = self._owner._point_index.find_point_at_position(...)

# Access owner's command manager
_ = self._owner._commands.command_manager.execute_command(command, main_window)
```

✅ **Helpers emit via owner (no own signals)**
- InteractionService is NOT a QObject (doesn't need signals)
- Helpers coordinate via direct method calls to owner
- State changes go through ApplicationState signals

**Composition Over Inheritance:**

The owner pattern here demonstrates **excellent composition**:
- Single file maintains cohesion (all interaction logic together)
- Internal organization via helpers (SRP within service)
- No QObject overhead for helpers (lightweight)
- Maintains 4-service architecture (single public interface)

**InteractionService Organization:**
```python
class InteractionService:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Create internal helpers (lightweight, not QObjects)
        self._selection = _SelectionManager(self)
        self._mouse = _MouseHandler(self)
        self._commands = _CommandHistory(self)
        self._points = _PointManipulator(self)
```

**Public API Delegation:**
```python
def find_point_at(self, view, x, y, mode="active") -> PointSearchResult:
    """Find point at screen coordinates with spatial indexing."""
    return self._selection.find_point_at(view, x, y, mode)
```

**Line Count Analysis:**
- Original: 1,478 lines (god object)
- Refactored: 1,450 lines (2% reduction, same functionality)
- Organized into 4 focused helpers (each ~200-400 lines)

**Score: 10/10** (textbook owner pattern implementation)

---

## 2. SOLID Principles Compliance

### 2.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Task 3.1 Controllers:**

✅ **TrackingDataController** (390 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Data loading, parsing, validation, and lifecycle management
- All methods relate to data operations (load, delete, rename, direction changes)
- No UI updates, no display logic, no selection logic
- Emits signals for coordination (`data_loaded`, `data_changed`)

✅ **TrackingDisplayController** (449 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Visual display updates ONLY
- Updates curve view, tracking panel, frame range UI
- Handles visibility and color changes
- No data loading, no selection management

✅ **TrackingSelectionController** (205 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Selection synchronization between panel and view
- Bridges tracking panel (curve-level selection) and curve view (point-level selection)
- Auto-selection logic for current frame
- No data loading, no display updates

**Task 3.2 Helpers:**

✅ **_MouseHandler** (269 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Mouse/keyboard event handling ONLY
- Press, move, release, wheel, key events
- No commands, no selection logic, no point manipulation

✅ **_SelectionManager** (255 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Point selection operations ONLY
- Find, select, clear, select-all logic
- Uses spatial index for performance
- No mouse handling, no commands

✅ **_CommandHistory** (263 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Undo/redo history management ONLY
- Command manager integration, legacy history support
- State save/restore
- No mouse handling, no selection logic

✅ **_PointManipulator** (212 lines)
- **Single Responsibility:** Point manipulation ONLY
- Update, delete, nudge operations
- No mouse handling, no selection, no history

**SRP Violations Found:** NONE

Each component has a clear, focused responsibility with high cohesion.

---

### 2.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Grade: GOOD (B+)**

**Extensibility Without Modification:**

✅ **Facade pattern allows adding new controllers**
- Can add new specialized controllers without changing facade structure
- Signal-based coordination makes extension points clear

✅ **Helper pattern allows adding new helpers**
- Can add new internal helpers to InteractionService
- Public API routes to new helpers via simple delegation

✅ **Protocol-based design allows substitution**
- Can swap implementations via protocols
- Easy to add new protocol implementations

**Extension Points via Signals:**

✅ **Task 3.1:** Signal connections allow new behaviors
```python
self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(new_observer.on_data_loaded)
```

✅ **Task 3.2:** ApplicationState signals allow reactive extensions
```python
self._app_state.curves_changed.connect(new_extension.on_curves_changed)
```

**Minor Limitation:**
- Adding new event types requires modifying _MouseHandler
- Could be improved with event handler registration pattern

**Overall:** Good extensibility via signals and protocols, minor limitations in event handling.

---

### 2.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Protocol-Based Substitutability:**

✅ **Controllers use MainWindowProtocol** (not concrete MainWindow)
```python
def __init__(self, main_window: MainWindowProtocol) -> None:
    self.main_window = main_window
```

✅ **Protocols enable mocking for tests**
- Any object implementing protocol can substitute
- No dependency on concrete implementation details
- Tests can use mock objects seamlessly

✅ **No assumptions about concrete types**
- Controllers access main_window through protocol interface
- Safe attribute access with None checks
- Graceful handling of missing methods via `callable()` checks

**Example of LSP-compliant code:**
```python
if callable(getattr(self.main_window.curve_widget, "update_curve_visibility", None)):
    self.main_window.curve_widget.update_curve_visibility(point_name, visible)
else:
    # Fallback for implementations without this method
    self.update_display_preserve_selection()
```

**No LSP Violations Found.**

---

### 2.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Grade: GOOD (B)**

**Well-Segregated Protocols:**

✅ **MainWindowProtocol** (lines 598-640)
- Minimal interface (8 properties/methods)
- Only methods controllers actually need
- Clear, focused purpose

✅ **CurveViewProtocol** (lines 478-564)
- Focused on curve view operations
- ~15 methods, all related to view management

✅ **TrackingPanelProtocol** (lines 567-587)
- Minimal interface (5 methods)
- Only tracking panel essentials

**ISSUE: ActionHandlerProtocol is monolithic** (lines 15-109)

❌ **30+ methods** mixing multiple concerns:
- File operations (new, open, save, export)
- View operations (zoom in/out/fit/reset)
- Edit operations (undo/redo, smooth, filter, analyze)
- Selection operations (select all)

**Impact:**
- Classes implementing this protocol must implement all 30+ methods
- Hard to create focused test doubles
- Violates "clients should not depend on methods they don't use"

**Recommendation:** Split into focused protocols:
```python
@runtime_checkable
class FileOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    def _on_action_new(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_open(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_save(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_save_as(self) -> None: ...

@runtime_checkable
class ViewOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    def _on_zoom_in(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_zoom_out(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_zoom_fit(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_reset_view(self) -> None: ...

@runtime_checkable
class EditOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    def _on_action_undo(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_redo(self) -> None: ...
    def apply_smooth_operation(self) -> None: ...
```

**Overall:** Most protocols well-segregated, one major violation.

---

### 2.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Dependency on Abstractions:**

✅ **Controllers depend on protocols** (abstractions)
```python
def __init__(self, main_window: MainWindowProtocol) -> None:
    self.main_window = main_window  # Protocol, not concrete class
```

✅ **Helpers depend on owner interface** (abstraction)
```python
def __init__(self, owner: "InteractionService") -> None:
    self._owner = owner  # Reference to owner interface
```

✅ **ApplicationState accessed via getter** (abstraction)
```python
self._app_state: ApplicationState = get_application_state()
```

**No Direct Concrete Dependencies:**

✅ **No hard-coded concrete classes**
- Controllers don't import MainWindow directly
- Helpers don't import concrete service implementations
- All dependencies injected via protocols

✅ **No circular dependencies detected**
- Facade imports controllers ✓
- Controllers import protocols ✓
- Helpers reference owner via type hint ✓

**Minor Coupling (Acceptable):**

TrackingSelectionController imports TrackingDisplayController (line 131):
```python
from ui.controllers.tracking_display_controller import TrackingDisplayController
```

**Assessment:** This is inside `on_tracking_points_selected()` for type checking the passed display_controller parameter. This is acceptable runtime type validation, not architectural coupling.

**Overall:** Excellent adherence to DIP throughout.

---

## 3. Architecture Quality

### 3.1 Coupling Analysis

**Grade: LOW COUPLING (Excellent)**

**Inter-Component Coupling:**

✅ **Facade → Controllers** (Expected coupling)
- Facade imports 3 controllers
- Creates instances
- Delegates methods
- **This is the designed coupling point** (facade pattern)

✅ **Controllers → Protocols** (Low coupling)
- Controllers depend on protocol interfaces
- No direct imports of concrete classes
- Easily testable via mocks

✅ **Helpers → Owner** (Low coupling)
- Helpers reference owner via `self._owner`
- Owner provides access to shared state
- No circular dependencies

**Signal-Based Loose Coupling:**

✅ **Controllers coordinate via signals** (not direct calls)
```python
self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(
    self.display_controller.on_data_loaded,
    Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection,
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Controllers don't directly call each other
- Can swap implementations without breaking others
- Easy to add new observers

**Coupling Metrics:**

| Component | Dependencies | Dependents |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Facade | 3 controllers, protocols | MainWindow |

**Overall:** Excellent cohesion throughout. Each component is focused and purposeful.

---

### 3.3 Separation of Concerns

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Clear Responsibility Boundaries:**

✅ **Data ↔ Display** (Task 3.1)
- TrackingDataController NEVER updates UI directly
- TrackingDisplayController NEVER loads data directly
- Communication via signals only

✅ **Display ↔ Selection** (Task 3.1)
- TrackingDisplayController updates view based on selection
- TrackingSelectionController manages selection state
- No cross-cutting concerns

✅ **Selection ↔ Data** (Task 3.1)
- TrackingSelectionController doesn't manipulate curve data

- Each owns its domain

✅ **Event Handling ↔ Commands** (Task 3.2)
- _MouseHandler captures events, doesn't execute commands
- _CommandHistory manages history, doesn't handle events
- Clean separation via signals to owner

**Layer Violations Checked:**

✅ **No layer violations detected**
- Controllers don't bypass services
- Helpers don't access ApplicationState directly (go through owner)
- Clean architectural layers maintained

**Cross-Cutting Concerns Handled Cleanly:**

```python
logger = get_logger("tracking_data_controller")
logger.info("TrackingDataController initialized")
```

✅ **Thread Safety** (handled via assertions)
```python
def _assert_main_thread(self) -> None:
    """Verify method called from main thread."""
```

✅ **Signal Connections** (explicit ConnectionType)
```python
Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection  # Documented thread-safety intent
```

**Overall:** Excellent separation of concerns. Clear boundaries, no violations.

---

## 4. Maintainability Assessment

### 4.1 Readability

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Code Style:**
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for methods, PascalCase for classes)
- ✅ Clear variable names (no abbreviations except standard ones like idx, dx, dy)
- ✅ Proper indentation and spacing
- ✅ Type hints throughout

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings for all classes
- ✅ Method docstrings with Args/Returns sections
- ✅ Clear comments explaining non-obvious logic
- ✅ Architecture documentation in file headers

**Example of excellent documentation:**
```python
"""
TrackingDataController - Handles loading and managing tracking data.

Part of the MultiPointTrackingController split (PLAN TAU Phase 3 Task 3.1).
"""
```

**Method Length:**
- ✅ Most methods < 50 lines
- ✅ Complex methods broken down (e.g., `_prepare_display_data`)
- ✅ Single level of abstraction per method

**Class Size:**
- ✅ All classes < 500 lines
- ✅ Largest: TrackingDisplayController (449 lines) - still readable
- ✅ Focused responsibilities prevent bloat

---

### 4.2 Complexity

**Grade: LOW COMPLEXITY (Excellent)**

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**
- ✅ Most methods have low branching (1-3 branches)
- ✅ Complex logic extracted to helper methods
- ✅ Early returns reduce nesting

**Example of low complexity:**
```python
def on_point_deleted(self, point_name: str) -> None:
    """Handle deletion of a tracking point."""
    if point_name in self._app_state.get_all_curve_names():
        self._app_state.delete_curve(point_name)
        if self.main_window.active_timeline_point == point_name:
            self.main_window.active_timeline_point = None
        if point_name in self.point_tracking_directions:
            del self.point_tracking_directions[point_name]
        self.data_changed.emit()
```

**State Management:**
- ✅ Minimal mutable state
- ✅ State centralized in ApplicationState
- ✅ Clear state transitions via signals

---

### 4.3 Extensibility

**Grade: EASY TO EXTEND (A)**

**Adding New Features:**

✅ **Add new controller to facade:**
```python
# Easy - just create new controller and wire signals
self.new_controller = NewController(main_window)
self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(self.new_controller.on_data_loaded)
```

✅ **Add new helper to InteractionService:**
```python
# Easy - just create new helper
self._new_helper = _NewHelper(self)
```

✅ **Add new protocol methods:**
```python
# Easy - add to protocol, implement in concrete class
class MainWindowProtocol(Protocol):
    def new_method(self) -> None: ...
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ Facade maintains all original methods
- ✅ Legacy method names preserved
- ✅ Gradual migration supported

**Overall:** Very easy to extend without breaking existing code.

---

### 4.4 Testability

**Grade: EASY TO TEST (A)**

**Protocol-Based Mocking:**

✅ **Controllers use protocols** - easy to mock
```python
# Test can provide mock MainWindowProtocol
mock_window = MockMainWindow()
controller = TrackingDataController(mock_window)
```

✅ **Helpers testable via owner mock**
```python
# Test can mock InteractionService
mock_service = MockInteractionService()
handler = _MouseHandler(mock_service)
```

**Dependency Injection:**
- ✅ All dependencies injected (not hard-coded)
- ✅ ApplicationState injectable via getter
- ✅ No global state dependencies

**Signal Testing:**
- ✅ Signals can be captured in tests
- ✅ Signal connections testable
- ✅ QueuedConnection behavior testable

**Unit Test Complexity:**

| Component | Test Complexity | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| TrackingDataController | LOW | Protocol-based, clear inputs/outputs |
| TrackingDisplayController | LOW | Protocol-based, signal-driven |
| TrackingSelectionController | LOW | Protocol-based, minimal state |
| _MouseHandler | MEDIUM | Needs Qt event mocks |
| _SelectionManager | LOW | Pure logic, protocol-based |
| _CommandHistory | MEDIUM | Complex history state |
| _PointManipulator | LOW | Clear input/output operations |

**Overall:** Excellent testability via protocols and dependency injection.

---

## 5. Qt-Specific Pattern Quality

### 5.1 QObject Usage

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Task 3.1: Controllers inherit QObject** ✅

All 3 controllers correctly inherit QObject:
```python
class TrackingDataController(QObject):
    """Handles loading and validating tracking data."""
    data_loaded = Signal(str, list)  # Needs QObject for signals
    load_error = Signal(str)
    data_changed = Signal()
```

**Reasoning:** Controllers need to emit signals for coordination.

**Task 3.2: Helpers are NOT QObjects** ✅

All 4 helpers are plain Python classes:
```python
class _MouseHandler:
    """Internal helper for mouse/keyboard event handling.

    NOT a QObject - lightweight helper class owned by InteractionService.
    """
```

**Reasoning:**
- Helpers don't emit signals (use owner service)
- Lightweight composition (no QObject overhead)
- Faster instantiation, less memory

**Task 3.2: InteractionService is NOT a QObject** ✅
```python
class InteractionService:
    """Consolidated interaction service - coordinates internal helpers."""
```

**Reasoning:**
- Service doesn't need signals (uses ApplicationState signals)
- Singleton pattern, not Qt object hierarchy
- Lightweight, fast access

**Overall:** Correct QObject usage - only where signals needed.

---

### 5.2 Signal/Slot Architecture

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Signal Definitions:**

✅ **Clear signal names** (descriptive, not cryptic)
```python
data_loaded = Signal(str, list)  # curve_name, curve_data
load_error = Signal(str)          # error_message
data_changed = Signal()           # no parameters
```

✅ **Signals documented** (what, when, why)
```python
"""
Signals:
    data_loaded: Emitted when tracking data successfully loaded (curve_name, curve_data)
    load_error: Emitted when loading fails (error_message)
    data_changed: Emitted when any tracking data changes
"""
```

**Signal Connections:**

✅ **ConnectionType specified** (explicit thread safety)
```python
self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(
    self.display_controller.on_data_loaded,
    Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection,  # Explicit queued connection
)
```

✅ **Connections in dedicated method**
```python
def _connect_sub_controllers(self) -> None:
    """Wire up sub-controller signals for coordination."""
```

✅ **Signal disconnection in __del__** (memory leak prevention)
```python
def __del__(self) -> None:
    """Disconnect all signals to prevent memory leaks."""
    try:
        self._app_state.curves_changed.disconnect(self._on_curves_changed)
        # ... more disconnections
    except (RuntimeError, AttributeError):
        pass  # Already disconnected or objects destroyed
```

**Signal Cycles Prevention:**

✅ **Recursion protection** via flags
```python
def _on_curves_changed(self, curves):
    if self._handling_signal:
        return  # Prevent recursion

    try:
        self._handling_signal = True
        # ... handle signal
    finally:
        self._handling_signal = False
```

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**

✅ **No tight coupling via direct method calls**
- Controllers communicate via signals
- Loose coupling maintained

✅ **No signal storms**
- Batch updates used where appropriate
- Recursion protection prevents loops

✅ **No missing ConnectionType in critical paths**
- All cross-object connections specify type
- Thread safety documented

**Overall:** Professional Qt signal/slot architecture.

---

### 5.3 Memory Management

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**QObject Parent/Child Relationships:**

✅ **Controllers created with proper ownership**
```python
self.data_controller = TrackingDataController(main_window)
# Controller's parent should be set for automatic cleanup
```

✅ **Signal disconnection in __del__**
```python
def __del__(self) -> None:
    """Disconnect all signals to prevent memory leaks."""
```

**Why this matters:**
- Qt signal connections keep objects alive
- Without disconnection, facade would never be garbage collected
- Memory leak in long-running application

**Helpers Don't Need Cleanup:**
- Not QObjects, no signals
- Python garbage collection handles them
- No parent/child relationships needed

**Overall:** Proper Qt memory management. Signal disconnection prevents leaks.

---

### 5.4 Thread Safety

**Grade: EXCELLENT (A)**

**Thread Affinity:**

✅ **Controllers execute in main thread** (QObject thread affinity)
```python
# Controllers inherit QObject, run in main thread
class TrackingDataController(QObject):
    ...
```

✅ **QueuedConnection for cross-object signals**
```python
Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection  # Ensures main thread execution
```

**Thread Safety Assertions:**

✅ **InteractionService verifies main thread**
```python
def _assert_main_thread(self) -> None:
    """Verify method called from main thread."""
    current = QThread.currentThread()
    app = QCoreApplication.instance()
    if app is not None:
        main = app.thread()
        if current != main:
            raise RuntimeError(...)
```

**Worker Thread Signal Handling:**

✅ **TrackingDataController logs thread context**
```python
current_thread = QThread.currentThread()
app_instance = QApplication.instance()
main_thread = app_instance.thread() if app_instance is not None else None
logger.info(
    f"[THREAD-DEBUG] on_tracking_data_loaded executing in thread: {current_thread} "
    f"(main={current_thread == main_thread})"
)
```

**Overall:** Excellent thread safety via Qt mechanisms and explicit assertions.

## 6. Critical Design Issues

### Issue 1: ActionHandlerProtocol is Too Large

**Severity: MEDIUM**

**Location:** `ui/protocols/controller_protocols.py`, lines 15-109

**Problem:**
- 30+ methods mixing multiple concerns
- Violates Interface Segregation Principle
- Hard to create focused test doubles
- Classes implementing this protocol must implement all 30+ methods

**Impact:**
- Maintainability: MEDIUM (hard to understand scope)
- Testability: MEDIUM (mock implementation complex)
- Extensibility: LOW (adding methods requires updating all implementations)

**Recommendation:**

Split into focused protocols:
```python
@runtime_checkable
class FileOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for file operations."""
    def _on_action_new(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_open(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_save(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_save_as(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_load_images(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_export_data(self) -> None: ...

@runtime_checkable
class ViewOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for view operations."""
    def _on_zoom_in(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_zoom_out(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_zoom_fit(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_reset_view(self) -> None: ...
    def update_zoom_label(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_zoom_in(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_zoom_out(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_reset_view(self) -> None: ...

@runtime_checkable
class EditOperationProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for edit operations."""
    def _on_action_undo(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_action_redo(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_select_all(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_add_point(self) -> None: ...
    def apply_smooth_operation(self) -> None: ...
    def _get_current_curve_data(self) -> object: ...
    def _on_smooth_curve(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_filter_curve(self) -> None: ...
    def _on_analyze_curve(self) -> None: ...
```

**Priority: MEDIUM** (should fix before Task 3.3)

---

### Issue 2: Minor Controller Coupling

**Severity: LOW**

**Location:** `ui/controllers/tracking_selection_controller.py`, line 131

**Problem:**
```python
from ui.controllers.tracking_display_controller import TrackingDisplayController
```

TrackingSelectionController imports TrackingDisplayController for runtime type checking.

**Impact:**
- Coupling: LOW (import is inside method, not at module level)
- Testability: LOW (can still mock the parameter)
- Maintainability: LOW (localized to one method)

**Assessment:**
This is acceptable. The import is for runtime type validation inside `on_tracking_points_selected()`. The controller receives `display_controller` as a parameter (via facade), so this is just defensive programming.

**Alternative (if strict decoupling desired):**
Use a protocol instead:
```python
class DisplayControllerProtocol(Protocol):
    def update_display_with_selection(self, selected: list[str]) -> None: ...
    def update_tracking_panel(self) -> None: ...
```

**Priority: LOW** (acceptable as-is, improve if time permits)

---

### Issue 3: Facade Has Minor Business Logic

**Severity: LOW**

**Location:** `ui/controllers/multi_point_tracking_controller.py`, lines 158-166

**Problem:**
Facade's `on_tracking_direction_changed()` contains small amount of logic:
```python
def on_tracking_direction_changed(self, point_name: str, new_direction: object) -> None:
    self.data_controller.on_tracking_direction_changed(point_name, new_direction)
    # Also trigger display updates
    self.display_controller.update_tracking_panel()
    # Force repaint to update colors immediately if active curve
    if self.main_window.active_timeline_point == point_name:
        if self.main_window.curve_widget:
            self.main_window.curve_widget.update()
```

**Assessment:**
This is **acceptable coordination logic**, not business logic. The facade needs to orchestrate the cross-cutting concern of keeping display in sync with data changes. This is exactly what a facade should do.

**Priority: VERY LOW** (acceptable as-is)

---

## 7. Design Improvements

### Improvement 1: Extract Display Update Coordination

**Priority: LOW**

**Current State:**
Facade has several methods that coordinate display updates after data changes:
- `on_tracking_direction_changed` (lines 158-166)
- `on_point_deleted` (lines 145-149)
- `on_point_renamed` (lines 151-155)

**Improvement:**
Extract to a coordination method in facade:
```python
def _coordinate_data_display_update(self, point_name: str | None = None) -> None:
    """Coordinate display updates after data changes.

    Args:
        point_name: Affected point name (for targeted updates)
    """
    self.display_controller.update_tracking_panel()

    if point_name and point_name == self.main_window.active_timeline_point:
        if self.main_window.curve_widget:
            self.main_window.curve_widget.update()
```

**Benefits:**
- DRY principle (don't repeat coordination logic)
- Single place to modify coordination behavior
- Clearer intent

---

### Improvement 2: Add Protocol for Display Controller

**Priority: LOW**

**Current State:**
TrackingSelectionController imports concrete TrackingDisplayController.

**Improvement:**
Create protocol in `controller_protocols.py`:
```python
@runtime_checkable
class TrackingDisplayProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for tracking display controller."""

    def update_display_with_selection(self, selected: list[str]) -> None:
        """Update display with explicit curve selection."""
        ...

    def update_tracking_panel(self) -> None:
        """Update tracking panel display."""
        ...
```

Update TrackingSelectionController:
```python
def on_tracking_points_selected(
    self,
    point_names: list[str],
    display_controller: TrackingDisplayProtocol  # Protocol instead of concrete
) -> None:
    """Handle selection of tracking points from panel."""
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates controller-to-controller coupling
- Easier testing (mock protocol instead of concrete class)
- Consistent with DIP principle

---

### Improvement 3: Consolidate QueuedConnection Usage

**Priority: LOW**

**Current State:**
Signal connections use QueuedConnection consistently, but pattern could be clearer.

**Improvement:**
Add a constant for connection type:
```python
# At top of multi_point_tracking_controller.py
DEFAULT_SIGNAL_CONNECTION = Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection | Qt.ConnectionType.UniqueConnection

def _connect_sub_controllers(self) -> None:
    """Wire up sub-controller signals for coordination."""
    self.data_controller.data_loaded.connect(
        self.display_controller.on_data_loaded,
        DEFAULT_SIGNAL_CONNECTION,
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Single place to change connection strategy
- UniqueConnection prevents duplicate connections
- Clearer intent

---

### Improvement 4: Add Helper Base Class (Optional)

**Priority: VERY LOW**

**Current State:**
All helpers repeat `self._owner` and `self._app_state` initialization.

**Improvement:**
Extract common pattern to base class:
```python
class _ServiceHelper:
    """Base class for internal service helpers."""

    def __init__(self, owner: "InteractionService") -> None:
        """Initialize with reference to owner service."""
        self._owner = owner
        self._app_state = get_application_state()

class _MouseHandler(_ServiceHelper):
    """Internal helper for mouse/keyboard event handling."""

    def __init__(self, owner: "InteractionService") -> None:
        super().__init__(owner)
        # Additional initialization
        self._drag_original_positions: dict[int, tuple[float, float]] | None = None
```

**Benefits:**
- DRY principle (common initialization in one place)
- Clearer inheritance hierarchy
- Easier to add common helper functionality

**Drawback:**
- Adds one level of indirection
- Not much shared code to justify base class

**Recommendation:** Skip this unless more shared behavior emerges.

### Recommendations for Task 3.3

1. **MUST DO:** Split ActionHandlerProtocol (2 hours)
   - Create FileOperationProtocol
   - Create ViewOperationProtocol
   - Create EditOperationProtocol
   - Update ActionHandlerController to implement all 3

2. **SHOULD DO:** Add TrackingDisplayProtocol (1 hour)
   - Define protocol in controller_protocols.py
   - Update TrackingSelectionController to use protocol
   - Eliminates concrete controller dependency

3. **NICE TO HAVE:** Extract coordination methods in facade (30 min)
   - Add `_coordinate_data_display_update()` method
   - Refactor `on_tracking_direction_changed`, `on_point_deleted`, `on_point_renamed`

4. **SKIP:** Helper base class
   - Not enough shared code to justify
   - Wait until more shared behavior emerges
