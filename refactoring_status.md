# CurveEditor Refactoring Update - May 2025

## Summary of Completed Work

### Architecture Migration ✅
- **Service Migration**: Completed migration to service-based architecture
- **Deprecated Files**: Removed all `.deprecated` files from the codebase
- **Import Patterns**: Modernized service imports to use direct names instead of aliases
- **New Services**: Added TransformationService for consolidated coordinate transformations

### Debug Cleanup ✅
- **Logging Implementation**: Added proper logging to all service classes and utility modules
- **Service Coverage**: Converted debug prints to logging in all services and modules:
  - `centering_zoom_service.py`
  - `settings_service.py`
  - `file_service.py`
  - `image_service.py`
  - `visualization_service.py`
  - `transformation_service.py`
  - `batch_edit.py`
  - `quick_filter_presets.py`
  - `curve_view_plumbing.py`
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with consistent logging patterns

### Code Quality Improvements ✅
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Created a dedicated TransformationService to centralize all coordinate transformation logic
- **Type Hints**: Enhanced parameter type checking with proper protocols
- **Circular Imports**: Eliminated remaining circular imports

## Current Status (May 5, 2025)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Debug prints cleaned | 100% | 100% |
| Test coverage | 55% | 80%+ |
| Services with tests | 6/11 | 11/11 |
| Deprecated files removed | 100% | 100% |
| Architecture migration | 100% | 100% |

## Remaining Work

### Short-term (0-1 month)
1. **Testing**
   - Complete tests for remaining services:
     - TransformationService, ImageService, FileService, DialogService, HistoryService
   - Add integration tests between services
   - Create tests for coordinate transformation functionality

### Medium-term (1-3 months)
1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement consistent recovery mechanisms
2. **Performance**
   - Optimize critical code paths
3. **Logging Enhancements**
   - Add log rotation and environment variable support

### Long-term (3+ months)
1. **Service Architecture**
   - Define explicit interfaces
   - Implement dependency injection
2. **Developer Experience**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Develop additional tooling

## Implementation Note

This consolidated documentation summarizes the key changes made to the CurveEditor codebase. The project has successfully transitioned to a service-based architecture and significantly improved code quality through consistent logging practices, reduced duplication, and enhanced type checking.
