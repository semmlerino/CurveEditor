# CurveEditor Refactoring Session Summary
## Date: 2025-05-28 (Second Session)

### Work Completed:
1. **Import Organization Fixes** - Fixed imports in 13 additional files:
   - All 6 extracted UI component files (visualization, smoothing, point_edit, status, timeline, toolbar)
   - 5 service files (visualization_service, analysis_service, dialog_service, history_service, image_service)
   - 2 other core files (dialogs.py, error_handling.py)

2. **Import Issues Fixed**:
   - Added missing imports (especially Qt widgets like QWidget, QVBoxLayout, etc.)
   - Reorganized imports according to PEP 8 standards
   - Fixed malformed import statements
   - Ensured standard library imports come first, then third-party, then local

3. **Total Progress**:
   - 20 files have had their imports fixed (7 from first session + 13 from this session)
   - All extracted component files now have proper imports
   - Many critical service files have been cleaned up

### Next Steps:
- Run fix_all_imports.py to process remaining Python files
- Check for circular imports
- Validate all imports work correctly
- Consider running the application to test functionality
