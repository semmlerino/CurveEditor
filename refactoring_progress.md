# Refactoring Progress - UI Components Split
## Date: 2025-05-25

### Task: Split ui_components.py into smaller modules

#### Status: IN PROGRESS

#### Analysis of ui_components.py:
1. File contains 1199 lines of code
2. Contains multiple component classes and the main UIComponents static class

#### Identified Components:
1. **Timeline Components**:
   - TimelineFrameMarker class (lines 45-76)
   - Timeline-related methods in UIComponents

2. **Point Edit Components**:
   - Point editing controls and UI elements

3. **Toolbar Components**:
   - Toolbar creation and action buttons

4. **Status Components**:
   - Status bar and quality metrics display

5. **Visualization Components**:
   - Grid, vectors, frame numbers, crosshair controls

#### Current State (as of 2025-05-25):
The component files have been created but ui_components.py still contains all original code:
- ✅ timeline_components.py - Created with TimelineFrameMarker and TimelineComponents classes
- ✅ point_edit_components.py - Created with PointEditComponents class
- ✅ toolbar_components.py - Created with ToolbarComponents class
- ✅ status_components.py - Created with StatusComponents class
- ❌ ui_components.py - Still contains all original code, needs refactoring

#### Next Steps:
1. ~~Create new component files~~ ✅ Already done
2. ~~Move relevant code to each file~~ ✅ Already done
3. Update ui_components.py to import from new modules ⬅️ CURRENT TASK
4. Remove duplicated code from ui_components.py
5. Update imports across the codebase
6. Create facade in ui_components.py for backward compatibility

### Progress Log:
- [2025-05-25 - Start] Beginning refactoring of ui_components.py
- [2025-05-25 - Update] Component files already exist, need to update ui_components.py to use them
- [2025-05-25 - 1st Change] Added imports for all component modules
- [2025-05-25 - 2nd Change] Removed duplicate TimelineFrameMarker class
- [2025-05-25 - 3rd Change] Replaced create_toolbar method to delegate to ToolbarComponents.create_toolbar
- [2025-05-25 - 4th Change] Updated create_control_panel to use PointEditComponents.create_point_info_panel for left panel
- [2025-05-25 - Note] connect_all_signals already delegates to SignalRegistry
- [2025-05-25 - 5th Change] Replaced Track Quality Group with StatusComponents.create_track_quality_panel
- [2025-05-25 - 6th Change] Fixed attribute names in StatusComponents for backward compatibility
- [2025-05-25 - 7th Change] Replaced Quick Filter Presets with StatusComponents.create_quick_filter_presets
- [2025-05-25 - 8th Change] Fixed attribute names in StatusComponents for quick filter presets
- [2025-05-25 - 9th Change] Created visualization_components.py for visualization controls
- [2025-05-25 - 10th Change] Replaced visualization controls section with VisualizationComponents.create_visualization_panel
- [2025-05-25 - 11th Change] Created smoothing_components.py for smoothing controls
- [2025-05-25 - 12th Change] Replaced smoothing controls section with SmoothingComponents.create_smoothing_panel
- [2025-05-26 - Continue] Continuing refactoring work, focusing on timeline widget delegation
- [2025-05-26 - Analysis] Timeline widget delegation is complex because TimelineComponents.create_timeline_widget expects callbacks as parameters while ui_components._create_timeline_widget directly connects to UIComponents static methods
- [2025-05-26 - 13th Change] Updated _create_timeline_widget to delegate to TimelineComponents.create_timeline_widget, passing UIComponents static methods as callbacks
- [2025-05-26 - 14th Change] Removed the now-unused _finish_timeline_widget method

### Remaining Tasks:
1. ✅ Import component modules
2. ✅ Remove TimelineFrameMarker class (imported from timeline_components)
3. ✅ Update create_toolbar to delegate to ToolbarComponents
4. ✅ Update create_control_panel to use PointEditComponents for left panel
5. ✅ Update _create_timeline_widget to delegate to TimelineComponents
6. ✅ Update visualization controls section (center panel) - extracted to VisualizationComponents
7. ✅ Update track quality/presets section to use StatusComponents
8. ✅ Extract smoothing controls to a new component
9. ⏳ Remove other methods that have been moved to component classes - IN PROGRESS
   - Timeline callback methods need to be moved to TimelineComponents
   - Visualization control methods need to be moved to VisualizationComponents
10. ❌ Update any remaining imports in other files that import from ui_components
11. ❌ Create facade methods for backward compatibility where needed
12. ❌ Run tests to verify all UI components work correctly after refactoring

### Issues Found:
- Timeline widget implementation differs between ui_components.py and timeline_components.py
- ✅ Status components had different attribute names (fixed for backward compatibility)
- Some methods in ui_components.py may need to remain for backward compatibility
- Need to verify all UI components work correctly after refactoring
