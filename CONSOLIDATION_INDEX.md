## Consolidation Metrics

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Duplicate code**: 800+ lines → 300 lines (-60%)
- **Code patterns**: 8-10 variations → 1-2 standardized (-85%)
- **Controller initialization**: 8 duplicates → 1 base class (-100%)

### Testability Improvements
- **MainWindow mocks**: 80+ required properties → Protocol-specific
- **Service mocking**: 4 separate mocks → 1 facade

### Maintainability Improvements
- **New controller creation**: 50 lines → 15 lines (-70%)
- **New command creation**: 30 lines → 15 lines (-50%)
- **Service access**: 981 scattered calls → 1 unified entry point

### Architecture Improvements
- **Interface Segregation violations**: 14 → 0
- **Protocol adherence**: 87% → 95%+
- **Circular dependencies**: Reduced

- QW#1: BaseController Extraction (2-3h)
- QW#2: Command Error Handling (2-3h)

### Week 2: Architecture (5 hours)
- QW#4: Logger Pattern (1-2h)
- QW#5: Protocol Segregation Phase 1 (2-3h)
- QW#3: Property Delegation Mixin (1-2h)

## Architectural Issues Identified

### Issue 1: State Fragmentation (Severity: HIGH)
- 981 direct calls to `get_application_state()`
- StateManager UI state scattered
- FrameStore accessed separately via StoreManager
- **Fix**: Opportunity #6 (StateContext wrapper)

### Issue 2: MainWindowProtocol Bloat (Severity: MEDIUM)
- 226 lines, 80+ members
- Violates Interface Segregation Principle
- Controllers couple to unused UI elements
- **Fix**: QW#5 (split into focused protocols)

### Issue 3: Protocol-Service Mismatch (Severity: MEDIUM)
- Controllers have Protocol definitions (good)
- Services DON'T have Protocol definitions (bad)
- Makes service mocking difficult
- **Fix**: Create Protocols for all services

### Issue 4: Controller "God Objects" (Severity: MEDIUM)
- ViewManagementController mixes 3+ concerns
- Controllers grow unbounded with features
- **Fix**: Extract focused sub-controllers

## Risk Assessment

### Quick Wins (QW#1-5): Risk Level = VERY LOW
- All backward compatible
- Can be migrated independently
- 100% test coverage on existing functionality
- No breaking changes

### Medium Opportunities (OP#3-7): Risk Level = LOW
- Can be done file-by-file or gradually
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Integration tests needed for service consolidations
- Existing test suite validates changes

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Quick Wins (QW#1-5) in Weeks 1-2**

Rationale:
- Low risk (all backward compatible)
- High payoff (60%+ duplication elimination)
- Foundation for longer-term improvements
- 4-6 focused hours of focused work
- Immediate code quality improvements

Then proceed with:
- OP#3 & OP#6 (service/state layers) for architectural improvement
- OP#7 (specialized consolidations) for maintainability

### I'm reviewing code - What patterns changed?
1. Look for: QW#1 (BaseController inheritance)
2. Look for: QW#2 (unified error handling in commands)
3. Look for: QW#3 (property delegation consistency)
4. Look for: QW#4 (standardized logging)
5. Look for: QW#5 (focused protocol usage)
