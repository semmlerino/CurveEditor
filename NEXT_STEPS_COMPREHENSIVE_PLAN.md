# CurveEditor Next Steps - Comprehensive Plan

## Current State (Post Sprint 11.5)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 92.9% (455/490 active tests)
- **Code Quality**: 0 linting errors
- **Architecture**: Consolidated 4-service model
- **Documentation**: Organized into structured directories
- **Production Readiness**: 85% (functional but needs polish)

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Day 1)
### 1.1 Commit Current Work
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: reorganize documentation and fix UI/rendering issues"
```
- Documentation reorganization into docs/ subdirectories
- QImage/QPixmap conversion fixes
- data_to_screen method fixes
- Sprint 8 test skip decorators

### 1.2 Clean Up Working Directory
- Review untracked files (COMMIT_READY.md, CRITICAL_FIX_RUNTIME.md, etc.)
- Decide what to keep vs. archive
- Remove backup files (*.backup)

## Phase 2: Test Stabilization (Days 2-3)
### 2.1 Fix Performance Benchmark Tests (4 errors)
- `test_selection_performance`
- `test_memory_cleanup_after_operations`
- `test_state_synchronization_performance`
- `test_timeline_panel_uses_moderncard`

### 2.2 Address Remaining Test Failures (31 failures)
Priority order:
1. Critical functionality tests
2. Integration tests
3. UI component tests
4. Performance benchmarks

### 2.3 Target Metrics
- Test pass rate: 95%+ (465+ of 490 tests)
- Zero critical failures
- All core functionality tests passing

## Phase 3: Architecture Cleanup (Days 4-5)
### 3.1 Remove Dual Architecture Complexity
- [ ] Remove USE_NEW_SERVICES environment variable checks
- [ ] Delete Sprint 8 legacy services:
  - services/selection_service.py
  - services/point_manipulation.py
  - services/history_service.py (Sprint 8 version)
  - services/event_handler.py
  - services/file_io_service.py
  - services/image_sequence_service.py
- [ ] Update all imports to use consolidated services only
- [ ] Clean up service initialization code

### 3.2 Service Consolidation Verification
- [ ] Verify all functionality works with 4-service model
- [ ] Remove redundant service delegation code
- [ ] Simplify service interfaces

### 3.3 Delete Obsolete Code
- [ ] Remove archive_obsolete/ directory after verification
- [ ] Clean up unused utility functions
- [ ] Remove deprecated methods

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Days 6-7)
### 4.1 Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Create comprehensive benchmark suite
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics:
  - Render time for 10,000 points
  - Pan/zoom responsiveness
  - Memory usage under load
  - File I/O performance

### 4.2 Optimization Targets
- [ ] Spatial indexing optimization (already implemented, verify integration)
- [ ] Transform caching improvements
- [ ] Render batching for large datasets
- [ ] Memory pool for frequently allocated objects

### 4.3 Performance Goals
- 60 FPS with 10,000 points
- < 100ms file load time for typical datasets
- < 50MB memory footprint for standard usage

## Phase 5: Production Polish (Days 8-10)
### 5.1 Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Add structured logging with levels
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Debug mode with verbose output

### 5.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation for missing features
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms for corrupted data
- [ ] Validation for all user inputs

### 5.3 User Documentation
- [ ] User manual (docs/user_guide.md)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts reference
- [ ] Video tutorials for common workflows
- [ ] FAQ and troubleshooting guide

### 5.4 Deployment
- [ ] Create requirements.txt with pinned versions
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Installation script for different platforms

## Phase 6: Feature Enhancement (Future)
### 6.1 Missing Features
- [ ] Multi-curve selection
- [ ] Advanced curve fitting algorithms
- [ ] Plugin system for custom operations
- [ ] Collaborative editing support

### 6.2 UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Customizable workspace layouts
- [ ] Improved keyboard navigation
- [ ] Context-sensitive help

### 6.3 Integration
- [ ] Export to common animation formats
- [ ] Import from various tracking software
- [ ] REST API for automation
- [ ] Command-line interface

## Success Metrics
### Week 1 Goals
- ✅ 95% test pass rate
- ✅ Single architecture (no dual mode)
- ✅ Clean working directory

### Week 2 Goals
- ✅ Performance benchmarks passing
- ✅ < 100 type checking errors
- ✅ Production deployment ready

### Month 1 Goals
- ✅ Full user documentation
- ✅ Docker container available
- ✅ 99% test coverage on critical paths

## Risk Mitigation
### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Monitor benchmarks after each change
2. **Breaking Changes**: Maintain comprehensive test suite
3. **Memory Leaks**: Use profiling tools regularly

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to phased approach
2. **Technical Debt**: Address as part of each phase
3. **Documentation Lag**: Update docs with each change

## Recommended Immediate Action
Start with Phase 1.1 - commit the current work to preserve progress, then systematically work through the phases. Each phase builds on the previous one and can be completed independently.
