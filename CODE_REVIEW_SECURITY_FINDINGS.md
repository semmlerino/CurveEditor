# Code Review - Security Findings

## Potential Security Concerns Found

### 1. Use of `eval()` Function
During the code review, I found references to `eval` in the following files:
- `ui_components.py`
- `track_quality.py`

**Recommendation:** The use of `eval()` is a security risk as it can execute arbitrary code. This should be investigated and replaced with safer alternatives like:
- `ast.literal_eval()` for evaluating literals
- `json.loads()` for parsing JSON data
- Direct parsing methods for specific data types

### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerability
The configuration handling in `config.py` doesn't validate file paths, which could lead to path traversal attacks.

**Current Code:**
```python
CONFIG_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'app_config.json')
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def validate_path(path: str) -> Path:
    """Validate and sanitize file paths."""
    # Convert to Path object
    p = Path(path).resolve()

    # Ensure path is within application directory
    app_dir = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
    try:
        p.relative_to(app_dir)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError(f"Path {path} is outside application directory")

    return p
```

### 3. Missing Input Validation
Several file operations lack proper input validation:
- File paths are not sanitized
- User inputs are not validated before processing
- No checks for malicious file content

### 4. Logging Sensitive Information
The application logs may contain sensitive information. Ensure that:
- File paths are not logged in production
- User data is not logged
- Error messages don't reveal system information

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Add Security Headers** (if web interface is planned)
   - Content Security Policy
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options

2. **Implement Input Sanitization**
   ```python
   import re

   def sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str:
       """Remove potentially dangerous characters from filenames."""
       # Allow only alphanumeric, dash, underscore, and dot
       return re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]', '', filename)
   ```

3. **Add Rate Limiting** for file operations to prevent DoS attacks

4. **Secure Configuration Storage**
   - Consider encrypting sensitive configuration
   - Use proper file permissions (chmod 600)
   - Store configs in user-specific directories

5. **Dependency Security**
   - Regularly update PySide6
   - Use tools like `safety` or `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependencies to specific versions

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Remove or replace all `eval()` usage** - Critical
2. **Add path validation to all file operations** - High
3. **Implement input sanitization** - High
4. **Review and sanitize all logging statements** - Medium

These security improvements should be prioritized alongside the other code review recommendations.
