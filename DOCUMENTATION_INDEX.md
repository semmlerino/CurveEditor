## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

### Update Frequency

| Document | Update Frequency | Last Updated |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| CLAUDE.md | As needed (architectural changes) | October 2025 |
| VERIFIED_KISS_DRY_ASSESSMENT.md | Static (point-in-time analysis) | October 2025 |
| KISS_DRY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md | Static (implementation guide) | October 2025 |
| PHASE4_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.txt | Static (historical) | October 2025 |
| PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_REPORT.txt | Quarterly (re-baseline) | TBD |

### Archive Policy

**When to archive**:
- Task completion reports: Archive after 3 months
- Planning documents: Archive when superseded
- Review reports: Archive when consolidated
- Decision documents: Archive when decisions implemented

**Retention**: Keep archived docs for 6-12 months, then safe to delete

## üìù Creating New Documentation

### Guidelines

1. **Add to CLAUDE.md**: For permanent architectural patterns, standards, conventions
2. **Create separate file**: For point-in-time analysis, planning, reports
3. **Update this index**: When adding new top-level documentation
4. **Archive when done**: Move completed work to `docs/archive/`

### Naming Convention

```
<TYPE>_<TOPIC>_<VARIANT>.md

Types: PLAN, REPORT, ASSESSMENT, SUMMARY, INDEX, GUIDE
Examples:
- KISS_DRY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- VERIFIED_KISS_DRY_ASSESSMENT.md
- PERFORMANCE_BASELINE_REPORT.txt
```
