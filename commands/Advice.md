echo "  Key principles to follow:

&nbsp; 1. Read actual implementations, don't make assumptions

&nbsp; 2. Adapt tests to code, but consider if the code has bugs

&nbsp; 3. Start running tests at the first opportunity.

&nbsp; 4. For new functionality/refactors, consider test-first approach

&nbsp; 5. Don't patch over real bugs - if a test fails, it might expose a real issue

&nbsp; 6. If implementation is suboptimal, fixing the code is on the table

&nbsp; 7. Use sequential thinking where needed

&nbsp; 8. Don't count task as done if ANY test is failing

&nbsp; 9. We have time, do not get overwhelmed if there are a large number of issues. Be systematic and thorough in your approach

&nbsp; 10. Avoid type ignore as last resort

&nbsp; 11. Research using the context7 MCP if unsure

&nbsp; 12. Step back and reassess periodically

&nbsp; 13. If test is skipped, fix or delete

&nbsp; 14. Don't create scripts, fix systematically

&nbsp; 15. Timeouts/aborts are failures. Investigate those.

&nbsp; 16. Ensure all tests follow best practices from @UNIFIED\_TESTING\_GUIDE"
