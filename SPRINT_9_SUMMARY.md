# Sprint 9: Type Safety & Testing - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Mission
Transform the codebase from 900 type errors to <50 while achieving 80% test coverage.

## 📊 Current State vs Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Challenge |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Type Errors** | 900 | <50 | 🔴 Critical |
| **Type Warnings** | 11,272 | <1,000 | 🟡 Medium |
| **Test Coverage** | Unknown | 80% | 🟡 Medium |
| **Test Files** | 19 + scattered | Organized | 🟢 Easy |
| **type: ignore** | 20 | <10 | 🟢 Easy |

## 🗓️ 7-Day Sprint Schedule

### Week Overview
```
Mon: Infrastructure Setup (PySide6 stubs, configs)
Tue: Service Types (200 errors)
Wed: UI Types (250 errors)
Thu: Data/Rendering Types (350 errors)
Fri: Test Organization & Coverage
Sat: Write Missing Tests (100+ tests)
Sun: Final Validation & Documentation
```

## 🔥 Top Priorities

### 1. Reduce Noise (Day 1)
- Install PySide6 type stubs
- Configure basedpyright to ignore library warnings
- Focus on OUR code's 900 errors, not library's 11,272 warnings

### 2. Type Critical Paths (Days 2-4)
- New Sprint 8 services (highest quality)
- UI components (most user-facing)
- Data pipelines (most critical)

### 3. Test Coverage (Days 5-6)
- Organize scattered test files
- Measure actual coverage
- Write tests for uncovered critical paths

### 4. Documentation (Day 7)
- Type patterns guide
- Testing best practices
- Migration plan for remaining issues

## 📈 Daily Targets

| Day | Errors to Fix | Tests to Add | Milestone |
|-----|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 200 (config) | 0 | Infrastructure ready |
| 2 | 200 | 20 | Services typed |
| 3 | 250 | 20 | UI typed |
| 4 | 350 | 20 | Core typed |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | Tests organized |
| 6 | 0 | 100 | Coverage achieved |
| 7 | 50 | 20 | Sprint complete |
| **Total** | **850** | **180** | **<50 errors, 80% coverage** |

## ⚠️ Risk Areas

### High Risk
- **Volume**: 900 errors ÷ 7 days = 130/day
- **PySide6**: Stubs may not exist/work
- **Time**: Aggressive timeline

### Mitigation
- Focus on critical errors first
- Suppress library warnings
- Accept 100 errors if needed
- Write meaningful tests, not padding

## 🎬 Quick Start Actions

### Immediate (Day 1 Morning)
```bash
# 1. Install type stubs
pip install types-PySide6-essentials

# 2. Update basedpyright config
{
  "reportUnknownMemberType": "none",
  "typeCheckingMode": "standard"
}

# 3. Baseline measurement
./bpr | tail -5
# Current: 900 errors, 11,272 warnings
```

### Daily Validation
```bash
# Check progress
./bpr | grep "error" | wc -l

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term

# Find remaining type: ignore
grep -r "type: ignore" --include="*.py" . | wc -l
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Success (70% confidence)
- ✅ Type errors < 100
- ✅ Test coverage > 70%
- ✅ All Sprint 8 services typed
- ✅ Tests organized

### Target Success (50% confidence)
- ✅ Type errors < 50
- ✅ Test coverage > 80%
- ✅ UI components typed
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Stretch Goals (20% confidence)
- ✅ Type errors < 25
- ✅ Test coverage > 90%
- ✅ Zero type: ignore
- ✅ All warnings resolved

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **It's worse than expected**: 900 errors vs 424 in plan (2x)
2. **Most warnings are noise**: 11,272 PySide6 warnings can be ignored
3. **Tests exist but scattered**: 600+ tests need organization
4. **Focus on safety, not perfection**: <100 errors is still a win

## 📝 Decision Points

### Day 3 Checkpoint
If behind schedule (>500 errors remain):
- Skip UI components
- Focus on services and core
- Accept 100-150 errors

### Day 5 Checkpoint
If coverage is already >70%:
- Skip extensive test writing
- Focus on type fixes
- Document remaining issues

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

By end of Sprint 9:
1. **Type safety**: Critical paths fully typed
2. **Test confidence**: 80% coverage achieved
3. **Maintainability**: Clear type patterns documented
4. **Developer experience**: Faster development with types
5. **Technical debt**: Reduced from critical to manageable

## 📌 Remember

> "Perfect is the enemy of good. We're aiming for safe and maintainable, not zero errors."

The goal is to make the codebase significantly safer and more maintainable, not to achieve perfection. Even reducing errors from 900 to 100 would be a massive improvement.
