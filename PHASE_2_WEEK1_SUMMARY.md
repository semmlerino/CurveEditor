# Phase 2 Week 1 Summary: Protocol Interfaces ✓

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced CurveViewProtocol
- Added `get_transform()` method for compatibility (used by optimized_curve_renderer.py)
- Already had `points`, `curve_data` attributes needed by multiple components
- Provides type-safe interface for 8+ files using curve views

### 2. Created BatchEditableProtocol
- Defined interface for batch editing parent components
- Includes attributes: `point_edit_layout`, `curve_view`, `selected_indices`
- Includes methods: `statusBar()`, `update_curve_data()`, `add_to_history()`
- Will enable fixing 10 hasattr() calls in batch_edit.py

### 3. Verified MainWindowProtocol Completeness
- Already has `statusBar()` method (line 248)
- Already has `selected_indices` attribute (line 194)
- Already has `state_manager` attribute (line 228)
- Already has `current_frame` property (added in Phase 1)
- No additional enhancements needed

## Current Metrics

| Metric | Start | Current | Goal |
|--------|-------|---------|------|
| Total hasattr() calls | 209 | 209 | <105 (50%) |
| Production files with hasattr | 19 | 19 | <10 |
| Basedpyright errors | 556 | 524 | <300 |
| Basedpyright warnings | 4650 | 4668 | N/A |

## Key Discoveries

### Actual hasattr() Distribution
The initial estimate of 97 calls was low. Actual distribution:
- **services/interaction_service.py**: 84 calls (40% of total!)
- **ui/main_window.py**: 21 calls
- **ui/modernized_main_window.py**: 15 calls
- **services/ui_service.py**: 13 calls
- **data/curve_view_plumbing.py**: 11 calls

### Priority Adjustment Needed
Original plan targeted 28 calls in Week 2. With interaction_service.py alone having 84 calls, Week 2 scope needs adjustment to focus on this single high-impact file.

## Tools Created

### 1. Migration Progress Tracker
- **Location**: `scripts/migration_progress.py`
- **Features**:
  - Counts hasattr() occurrences by file
  - Categorizes by component type
  - Tracks basedpyright metrics
  - Shows progress against goals
  - Identifies priority files

### 2. Phase 2 Plan Document
- **Location**: `PHASE_2_TYPE_SAFETY_PLAN.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Pattern classification & solutions
  - Refactoring strategies by pattern type
  - Implementation schedule
  - Success criteria & risk mitigation

## Next Steps: Week 2

### Adjusted Priority
Focus on the highest-impact file first:

1. **services/interaction_service.py (84 hasattr)**
   - Represents 40% of all hasattr() calls
   - Critical for user interaction handling
   - Single file could achieve significant progress

2. **ui/main_window.py (21 hasattr)**
   - Central component, affects entire app
   - Good test case for Optional typing patterns

3. **If time permits**:
   - ui/modernized_main_window.py (15 hasattr)
   - services/ui_service.py (13 hasattr)

### Refactoring Strategy for interaction_service.py

Based on initial analysis, the 84 hasattr() calls likely fall into:
- Component availability checks (drag_handler, selection_handler, etc.)
- State attribute checks (_drag_start_pos, _selection_origin, etc.)
- Method availability checks (update, repaint, setCursor, etc.)

Recommended approach:
1. Initialize all state attributes in `__init__` with Optional types
2. Use Protocol types for component interfaces
3. Replace hasattr checks with `is not None` checks
4. Add proper type hints throughout

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify actual metrics** - Initial grep patterns undercounted by 2x
2. **Service consolidation created hotspots** - interaction_service.py accumulated many checks
3. **Protocols already well-defined** - Less work needed than expected for Week 1
4. **Migration effort larger than anticipated** - May need 6 weeks instead of 4

## Success Indicators

✅ All Week 1 protocol tasks completed
✅ Migration tracking tools operational
✅ Clear path forward for Week 2
✅ No regression in functionality
