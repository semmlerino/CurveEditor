# PLAN TAU Task 3.3 Architectural Assessment Report

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Task**: StateManager Data Delegation Removal (Phase 3, Task 3.3)
**Assessor**: Python Expert Architect Agent

---

## Executive Summary

**Architectural Grade**: **B+** (Strong approach with one critical gap)

**SOLID Compliance**: **A+** (Significantly improves SRP and ISP)

**Recommendation**: **APPROVE with REQUIRED corrections** - Address signal migration gap before implementation.

**Impact**: This migration will **significantly reduce technical debt** (~210 lines removed) and establish ApplicationState as the true single source of truth for application data.

---

## 1. Architectural Impact Assessment

### 1.1 Does This Achieve "Single Source of Truth"?

**Grade: A** ✅ **YES - Goal Achieved**

**Current Architecture** (Two sources of truth):
```
Components → StateManager (delegation layer) → ApplicationState (actual data)
                  ↓
           UI State (zoom, pan, tools)
```

**After Task 3.3** (Single source of truth):
```
Components → ApplicationState (data)
          ↘ StateManager (UI state only)
```

**Analysis**:
- StateManager currently has ~25 @property decorators, several delegating to ApplicationState
- After migration, StateManager will contain ONLY UI-specific state:
  - View state: `zoom_level`, `pan_offset`, `view_bounds`
  - Window state: `window_size`, `window_position`, `is_fullscreen`
  - Tool state: `current_tool`, `playback_mode`
  - Transient UI: `hover_point`, `active_timeline_point`
  - File/session: `current_file`, `is_modified`, `file_format`
  - Preferences: `recent_directories`

**Separation Quality**: EXCELLENT - Clean boundary between data (ApplicationState) and UI preferences (StateManager).

### 1.2 Hidden Coupling Points

**Grade: B-** ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED**

The inventory captured property access but **missed signal connections**:

**Found via supplementary analysis**:
```bash
# Signal connections NOT in original inventory:
ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:
  - state_manager.frame_changed.connect (1 connect, 2 disconnects)

ui/controllers/signal_connection_manager.py:
  - state_manager.selection_changed.connect (1 connection)
  - state_manager.total_frames_changed.connect (1 connection) ✅ WAS found

ui/timeline_tabs.py:
  - state_manager.frame_changed.connect (1 connect, 2 disconnects)
```

**Total Signal Connections**:
- `frame_changed`: 2 connections, 4 disconnections
- `selection_changed`: 1 connection
- `total_frames_changed`: 1 connection ✅ (already inventoried)

**Impact**: These signals are **currently forwarded** by StateManager:
```python
# In StateManager.__init__:
self._app_state.frame_changed.connect(self.frame_changed.emit)
self._app_state.selection_changed.connect(self._on_app_state_selection_changed)
```

**Migration Required**: Update all signal connections to use ApplicationState directly:
```python
# Before:
state_manager.frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)

# After:
get_application_state().frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)
```

**Recommendation**: Run supplementary inventory for signal connections (see Section 5.1).

### 1.3 Will This Create New Architectural Debt?

**Grade: A-** ✅ **NET DEBT REDUCTION**

**Debt Removed**:
1. ~210 lines of delegation code
2. DEPRECATED comments throughout
3. "Which API to use?" confusion
4. Double source of truth anti-pattern

**Potential New Debt**:
1. **Boilerplate active_curve checking**: MINOR, acceptable
   ```python
   state = get_application_state()
   active = state.active_curve
   if active is None:
       return
   ```
   - This pattern will appear in ~5-10 locations
   - Trade-off: Explicit is better than implicit (Zen of Python)
   - Mitigation: Could extract to decorator if it becomes painful

2. **data_bounds calculation logic**: NEEDS MIGRATION, not removal
   - Currently in StateManager (17 lines of calculation logic)
   - Should move to ApplicationState as `get_data_bounds(curve_name)` method
   - If inlined at callsite → creates debt (duplicated logic)
   - If moved to ApplicationState → no debt (proper location)

**Net Impact**: Removes major architectural debt, adds minor acceptable boilerplate.

### 1.4 Service Architecture Compliance

**Grade: A+** ✅ **PERFECT - Services Unaffected**

**Critical Finding**: The inventory shows **NO service files** impacted.

**Why this is excellent**:
- Services (DataService, InteractionService, TransformService, UIService) already use ApplicationState directly
- They never depended on StateManager for data access
- This migration is **UI layer only** - services maintain clean architecture

**4-Service Architecture**: ✅ **MAINTAINED** - No changes needed to service layer.

---

## 2. Migration Pattern Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Pattern 1: current_frame (25 callsites)

**Pattern**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.current_frame
# After:  get_application_state().current_frame
```

**Grade: A** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Analysis**:
- Direct property replacement (ApplicationState has `current_frame` as `@property`)
- No active_curve dependency needed
- Type-safe: both return `int`
- Idiomatic Python singleton pattern

**Complexity**: LOW - Simple find/replace with context awareness.

### 2.2 Pattern 2: total_frames (9 callsites)

**Pattern (as documented)**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.total_frames
# After:  get_application_state().total_frames
```

**Grade: C** ⚠️ **API INCONSISTENCY ISSUE**

**Critical Finding**: ApplicationState does NOT have `total_frames` as a property!

**Actual ApplicationState API**:
```python
def get_total_frames(self) -> int:  # METHOD, not property
```

**Correct Pattern**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.total_frames
# After:  get_application_state().get_total_frames()  # Method call!
```

**Recommendations**:
1. **Option A** (Quick fix): Update migration pattern documentation to use `get_total_frames()`
2. **Option B** (API consistency): Add `total_frames` property to ApplicationState:
   ```python
   @property
   def total_frames(self) -> int:
       """Get total frames (derived from image files)."""
       return self.get_total_frames()
   ```
   - Pro: Consistent API (current_frame is property, total_frames is property)
   - Con: Adds minor code, but improves DX

**Impact**: If not corrected, migration will cause immediate runtime errors.

### 2.3 Pattern 3: selected_points (3 callsites)

**Pattern**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.selected_points
# After:  state = get_application_state()
#         active = state.active_curve
#         selection = state.get_selection(active) if active else set()
```

**Grade: B** ⚠️ **TYPE MISMATCH ISSUE**

**Analysis**:
- StateManager returns `list[int]` (sorted via `sorted(...)`)
- ApplicationState returns `set[int]` (unordered)
- Pattern shows returning `set()` on None case

**Type Safety Concern**: Callsites expecting list operations will break:
```python
# If code does this:
selected = state_manager.selected_points
first_selected = selected[0]  # IndexError on set!
```

**Correct Pattern** (backward compatible):
```python
# Maintain list[int] return type
state = get_application_state()
active = state.active_curve
selection = sorted(state.get_selection(active)) if active else []
```

**Alternative** (more Pythonic, requires refactoring callsites):
```python
# Embrace sets (no ordering needed)
state = get_application_state()
active = state.active_curve
selection = state.get_selection(active) if active else set()
# Callsites must handle sets correctly
```

**Recommendation**: Use sorted list for backward compatibility unless callsites are refactored.

### 2.4 Pattern 4: data_bounds (1 callsite)

**Pattern**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.data_bounds
# After:  Calculate from get_application_state().get_curve_data(active)
```

**Grade: C** ⚠️ **BUSINESS LOGIC MIGRATION NEEDED**

**Critical Issue**: This is NOT simple delegation - StateManager contains calculation logic:

```python
# StateManager.data_bounds property (17 lines):
@property
def data_bounds(self) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    active_curve = self._app_state.active_curve
    if not active_curve:
        return (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    curve_data = self._app_state.get_curve_data(active_curve)
    if not curve_data:
        return (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    # BUSINESS LOGIC: Extract coords and compute bounds
    x_coords = [float(point[1]) for point in curve_data]
    y_coords = [float(point[2]) for point in curve_data]
    return (min(x_coords), min(y_coords), max(x_coords), max(y_coords))
```

**Problem**: Where should this logic go?

**Options**:
1. **Inline at callsite** (main_window.py:833)
   - Pro: Quick migration
   - Con: Logic is lost, not reusable, creates debt if needed elsewhere

2. **Move to ApplicationState** as `get_data_bounds(curve_name: str | None) -> tuple[float, ...]`
   - Pro: Proper location (data layer), reusable, no debt
   - Con: Requires adding method to ApplicationState

3. **Create utility function** in `core/` module
   - Pro: Separation of concerns
   - Con: Adds indirection, less discoverable

**Recommendation**: **Option 2** - Add to ApplicationState for clean migration.

### 2.5 Pattern 5: set_image_files (1 callsite)

**Pattern**:
```python
# Before: state_manager.set_image_files(files)
# After:  get_application_state().set_image_files(files, directory)
```

**Grade: B+** ✅ **MOSTLY GOOD**

**Issue**: API signature difference:
- StateManager: `set_image_files(files: list[str])`
- ApplicationState: `set_image_files(files: list[str], directory: str | None = None)`

**Migration**: Callsite needs to provide `directory` parameter or use default `None`.

Looking at the callsite (view_management_controller.py:237):
```python
self.main_window.state_manager.set_image_files(image_files)
```

Needs context to determine if directory should be passed. This requires manual inspection.

---

## 3. StateManager Post-Migration Assessment

### 3.1 What Remains in StateManager?

**UI-Specific State** (legitimate):
- `zoom_level`, `pan_offset`, `view_bounds` - Camera/view state
- `window_size`, `window_position`, `is_fullscreen` - Window preferences
- `current_tool`, `playback_mode` - Tool/playback state
- `hover_point` - Transient UI state
- `recent_directories` - User preferences

**Questionable State** (gray area):
- `current_file`, `is_modified`, `file_format` - Document/session state
  - Could argue this belongs in ApplicationState
  - But it's metadata about the session, not the data itself
  - **Verdict**: Acceptable in StateManager (session management)

- `active_timeline_point` - Which tracking point's timeline is shown
  - This is UI state (which view to show)
  - **Verdict**: Correct location

**Signals** (after migration):
- UI-specific signals remain: `view_state_changed`, `playback_state_changed`, `tool_state_changed`
- Data signals **removed**: `frame_changed`, `selection_changed`, `total_frames_changed` (consumers connect to ApplicationState)

### 3.2 Separation of Concerns Quality

**Grade: A** ✅ **CLEAN SEPARATION**

**Post-Migration Responsibilities**:
- **ApplicationState**: Application data (curves, frames, selection, images)
- **StateManager**: UI preferences, view state, session metadata

This follows **Single Responsibility Principle** perfectly.

### 3.3 Should StateManager Be Renamed?

**Current Name**: `StateManager`

**After Migration**: Contains only UI/session state, not application data.

**Naming Options**:
1. Keep `StateManager` (generic, covers UI state)
2. Rename to `UIStateManager` (explicit)
3. Rename to `ViewPreferences` (descriptive)
4. Rename to `SessionState` (emphasizes session/file metadata)

**Recommendation**: **Keep as StateManager** for now.
- Renaming is a breaking change across the codebase
- "State" is accurate (it manages state, just not *data* state)
- Documentation (CLAUDE.md) already clarifies its role
- **Nice-to-have, not critical** - defer to Phase 4 if desired

### 3.4 Potential Confusion Points

**Low Risk**:
- After migration, trying to access `state_manager.track_data` raises `AttributeError` immediately
- Type checkers will catch incorrect usage at development time
- Self-documenting through failure (fail-fast is good)

**Documentation Needed**:
- CLAUDE.md already states: "StateManager handles UI preferences and view state" ✅
- ApplicationState section is comprehensive ✅
- No additional documentation needed

---

## 4. Testing Strategy Assessment

### 4.1 Proposed Strategy

**From analysis document**:
1. Test after each file migration
2. Full test suite at end
3. Type check each file with `./bpr`
4. Count properties before/after

**Grade: B+** ✅ **ADEQUATE but could be strengthened**

### 4.2 Strengths

1. **Incremental testing**: Catches issues early, allows per-file rollback
2. **Type checking**: `./bpr` catches type errors immediately
3. **Full integration test**: Final test suite validates everything
4. **Heuristic verification**: Property count is a good sanity check

### 4.3 Weaknesses

1. **No explicit integration tests for migration**:
   - How to verify all delegation is removed?
   - How to verify signals are properly migrated?

2. **Property count is not definitive**:
   ```bash
   # Proposed:
   grep -c "@property" ui/state_manager.py
   # Before: ~50, After: ~15
   ```

   Better verification:
   ```bash
   # Verify no data delegation remains:
   grep -E "self\._app_state\.(get_curve_data|get_selection|current_frame)" ui/state_manager.py
   # Should only appear in signal forwarding or be empty
   ```

3. **Missing regression prevention tests**:
   ```python
   def test_state_manager_has_no_data_delegation():
       """Verify StateManager has no data delegation after Task 3.3."""
       state_manager = StateManager()

       # These should not exist after migration
       assert not hasattr(state_manager, 'track_data')
       assert not hasattr(state_manager, 'has_data')
       assert not hasattr(state_manager, 'data_bounds')
       assert not hasattr(state_manager, 'selected_points')

       # current_frame and total_frames also removed
       # (consumers use ApplicationState directly)
   ```

4. **Type checking scope**: Plan shows per-file `./bpr`, but should also run full `./bpr` at end to catch cross-file type issues

### 4.4 Regression Risk

**Assessment**: MEDIUM-LOW

**Mitigations in place**:
- Good test coverage already exists
- Manual migration (not automated regex) reduces errors
- Incremental testing catches issues early
- Git checkpoint allows rollback

**Additional Mitigation Needed**:
- Signal migration must be included (currently missing from inventory)
- Add regression test for no data delegation (prevents future backsliding)

---

## 5. Long-Term Maintainability

### 5.1 Will Future Developers Know Which API to Use?

**Grade: A-** ✅ **YES - Clear Guidance**

**After Migration**:
1. **Self-documenting**: Accessing removed properties raises `AttributeError`
2. **Type hints guide usage**: IDEs autocomplete shows correct methods
3. **CLAUDE.md documents pattern**: Already states "ApplicationState is single source of truth"
4. **Fail-fast**: Mistakes are caught immediately, not silently

**Potential Footguns**:

1. **Forgetting active_curve check**:
   ```python
   # ❌ Potential mistake:
   data = get_application_state().get_curve_data(None)  # Returns empty list
   ```

   **Mitigation**: ApplicationState already handles `None` safely (returns empty list). Not a footgun.

2. **Confusion about current_frame location**:
   - Before: Available in both StateManager and ApplicationState
   - After: ONLY in ApplicationState
   - **Impact**: Clear separation, no confusion

3. **Signal connections**:
   - Before: `state_manager.frame_changed.connect(...)`
   - After: `get_application_state().frame_changed.connect(...)`
   - Old code fails immediately with `AttributeError` ✅

**Documentation Status**: ADEQUATE - CLAUDE.md already covers the pattern.

### 5.2 Should There Be Linting Rules?

**Grade: N/A** - Not needed

**Natural Enforcement**:
- Removed properties don't exist → `AttributeError` at runtime
- Type checker catches incorrect usage at development time
- No additional tooling required

**For single-user desktop app**: Natural enforcement is sufficient.

### 5.3 Long-Term Technical Debt Impact

**Current Debt** (before Task 3.3):
1. Two sources of truth (StateManager + ApplicationState)
2. Confusing API ("which one do I use?")
3. ~210 lines of delegation code
4. DEPRECATED comments everywhere

**After Task 3.3**:
1. ✅ Single source of truth (ApplicationState)
2. ✅ Clear API (no confusion)
3. ✅ ~210 lines removed
4. ✅ No deprecated code

**New "Debt" Added**:
1. Active curve checking boilerplate (~5-10 locations)
   - **Assessment**: Not debt - explicit is better than implicit
   - Acceptable trade-off for clarity

2. Repeated `get_application_state()` calls
   - **Assessment**: Not debt - proper dependency on data layer
   - Pattern is cached in local variable within methods

**Net Debt Change**: **SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION** (~200 lines removed, clearer architecture)

**Grade: A-** for long-term impact.

---

## 6. SOLID Principles Compliance

### 6.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Before Task 3.3**:
- StateManager has TWO responsibilities:
  1. UI state management (zoom, pan, tools)
  2. Data delegation (forwarding to ApplicationState)

**After Task 3.3**:
- StateManager: UI state ONLY
- ApplicationState: Data ONLY

**Grade: A+** ✅ **PERFECT SRP IMPROVEMENT**

### 6.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Impact**: MINOR improvement
- Removing delegation makes extension clearer
- Extend ApplicationState for data features, StateManager for UI features

**Grade: B+** - Slight improvement, not primary focus.

### 6.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Impact**: N/A - No inheritance hierarchies affected.

### 6.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Before**: StateManager is a "fat interface" with both UI and data methods
**After**: Two focused interfaces:
- StateManager: UI state operations
- ApplicationState: Data operations

**Grade: A** ✅ **SIGNIFICANT ISP IMPROVEMENT**

### 6.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Current State**: Components depend on concrete classes (StateManager, ApplicationState)

**After Migration**: Still depends on concrete classes (no change)

**Assessment**: For single-user desktop app, concrete dependencies are acceptable.

**Grade: C** - No change, but acceptable for context.

### 6.6 Overall SOLID Assessment

**Grade: A+** ✅ **This migration SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES SOLID compliance**

Primary improvements: **SRP** (major) and **ISP** (significant)

---

## 7. Critical Concerns (Showstoppers)

### 7.1 Signal Migration Not Inventoried 🔴 CRITICAL

**Severity**: HIGH - Could cause silent UI failures

**Issue**: Inventory only checked property access, NOT signal connections.

**Found via supplementary analysis**:
- `frame_changed`: 2 connections, 4 disconnections (frame_change_coordinator.py, timeline_tabs.py)
- `selection_changed`: 1 connection (signal_connection_manager.py)
- `total_frames_changed`: 1 connection (already inventoried) ✅

**Impact**: If signals aren't migrated, components won't receive data updates.

**Mitigation**: Required before starting implementation (see Section 8.1).

**Blocker Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKS IMPLEMENTATION** until corrected.

### 7.2 total_frames API Inconsistency 🟡 MEDIUM

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Will cause immediate errors but easy to fix

**Issue**: ApplicationState uses `get_total_frames()` method, not `total_frames` property.

**Impact**: Migration pattern documentation is incorrect.

**Mitigation**: Update documentation OR add property to ApplicationState (see Section 8.2).

**Blocker Status**: ⚠️ Fixable during implementation, but must be addressed.

### 7.3 selected_points Type Mismatch 🟡 MEDIUM

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Could cause runtime errors

**Issue**: StateManager returns `list[int]`, ApplicationState returns `set[int]`.

**Impact**: Callsites expecting list operations (indexing) will break.

**Mitigation**: Use `sorted(state.get_selection(active))` for backward compatibility (see Section 8.3).

**Blocker Status**: ⚠️ Fixable during implementation with correct pattern.

### 7.4 data_bounds Business Logic 🟡 MEDIUM

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Easy to mess up if not recognized

**Issue**: Not simple delegation - contains 17 lines of calculation logic.

**Impact**: Logic could be lost if migration is done as simple "change the call".

**Mitigation**: Move logic to ApplicationState as `get_data_bounds()` method (see Section 8.4).

**Blocker Status**: ⚠️ Requires architectural decision, but straightforward.

### 7.5 Cleanup Scope Unclear 🟡 MEDIUM

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Affects time estimate

**Issue**: Plan mentions ~210 lines of delegation + ~140 lines infrastructure = ~350 total. Which is correct?

**Analysis**: Looking at StateManager:
- Data delegation properties: ~210 lines (7 properties × ~30 lines each)
- Helper methods: ~140 lines (e.g., `_get_curve_name_for_selection()`)
- Total removal: ~350 lines

**Clarification**: Both numbers are correct:
- ~210 lines: Delegation properties
- ~350 lines: Properties + supporting infrastructure

**Impact on time**: Removing 350 lines is consistent with 1-1.5 day estimate.

**Blocker Status**: ✅ No blocker - just a documentation clarity issue.

---

## 8. Strategic Recommendations

### 8.1 Complete Signal Inventory (REQUIRED) 🔴

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete before implementation

**Action**:
```bash
# Add to phase3_task33_inventory.txt:
echo "" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "## Signal connections requiring migration:" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt

echo "### frame_changed signal:" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
grep -rn "state_manager\.frame_changed\.\(connect\|disconnect\)" ui/ services/ core/ --include="*.py" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt

echo "" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "### selection_changed signal:" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
grep -rn "state_manager\.selection_changed\.\(connect\|disconnect\)" ui/ services/ core/ --include="*.py" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt

echo "" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "### total_frames_changed signal:" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
grep -rn "state_manager\.total_frames_changed\.\(connect\|disconnect\)" ui/ services/ core/ --include="*.py" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt

echo "" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "SIGNAL MIGRATION SUMMARY:" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
echo "Total signal connections: $(grep -r 'state_manager\.\(frame_changed\|selection_changed\|total_frames_changed\)\.connect' ui/ services/ core/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)" >> phase3_task33_inventory.txt
```

**Expected Results**:
- frame_changed: 2 connect, 4 disconnect (3 files)
- selection_changed: 1 connect (1 file)
- total_frames_changed: 1 connect (1 file)

**Migration Pattern**:
```python
# Before:
self.main_window.state_manager.frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)

# After:
get_application_state().frame_changed.connect(self.on_frame_changed)
```

**Files to update**:
1. `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py` (1 connect, 2 disconnects)
2. `ui/controllers/signal_connection_manager.py` (2 connections: selection_changed, total_frames_changed)
3. `ui/timeline_tabs.py` (1 connect, 2 disconnects)

**Impact**: Adds 3 files to migration (already in list, but signals not noted).

### 8.2 Resolve total_frames API Inconsistency 🟡

**Priority**: HIGH - Must resolve before implementation

**Option A**: Update migration documentation (quick fix)
```python
# Update phase3_task33_analysis.txt pattern:
# Before: state_manager.total_frames
# After:  get_application_state().get_total_frames()  # METHOD call
```

**Option B**: Add property to ApplicationState (API consistency)
```python
# In stores/application_state.py:
@property
def total_frames(self) -> int:
    """Get total frames (derived from image files length)."""
    return self.get_total_frames()
```

**Recommendation**: **Option B** - Provides API consistency with `current_frame` property.
- Both `current_frame` and `total_frames` become properties
- More intuitive for developers
- Small addition (~3 lines)

### 8.3 Handle selected_points Type Mismatch 🟡

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Address during implementation

**Recommendation**: Use sorted list for backward compatibility:

```python
# Migration pattern (update phase3_task33_analysis.txt):
# Before: state_manager.selected_points
# After:  state = get_application_state()
#         active = state.active_curve
#         selection = sorted(state.get_selection(active)) if active else []
#         # Returns list[int] for backward compatibility
```

**Alternative** (more Pythonic, requires refactoring):
- Refactor 3 callsites to work with sets directly
- Embrace `set[int]` as the native type
- Only do this if callsites don't rely on list ordering/indexing

**Action**: Inspect 3 callsites to determine if list operations are actually needed:
1. `ui/controllers/point_editor_controller.py:233`
2. `ui/controllers/point_editor_controller.py:251`
3. `ui/main_window.py:485`

### 8.4 Move data_bounds Business Logic 🟡

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Architectural decision needed

**Recommendation**: Add to ApplicationState for clean migration:

```python
# In stores/application_state.py:
def get_data_bounds(self, curve_name: str | None = None) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Get data bounds as (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) for a curve.

    Args:
        curve_name: Name of curve (None = active curve)

    Returns:
        Tuple of (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y), or (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0) if no data
    """
    if curve_name is None:
        curve_name = self.active_curve

    if not curve_name:
        return (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    curve_data = self.get_curve_data(curve_name)
    if not curve_data:
        return (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    # Extract x and y coordinates (indices 1 and 2 in CurveDataList)
    x_coords = [float(point[1]) for point in curve_data]
    y_coords = [float(point[2]) for point in curve_data]

    return (min(x_coords), min(y_coords), max(x_coords), max(y_coords))
```

**Benefits**:
- Logic preserved in data layer (correct location)
- Reusable for other components
- Clean migration (just change the call)

**Alternative**: Inline at callsite (only 1 usage, but loses reusability).

### 8.5 Add Verification Tests 🟢

**Priority**: NICE-TO-HAVE - Prevents future regression

**Recommendation**: Add post-migration verification test:

```python
# In tests/test_state_manager.py or new tests/test_task33_verification.py:
def test_state_manager_has_no_data_delegation():
    """
    Verify StateManager has no data delegation after PLAN TAU Task 3.3.

    This test prevents regression - ensures future changes don't re-introduce
    the data delegation anti-pattern that was removed in Task 3.3.
    """
    from ui.state_manager import StateManager

    state_manager = StateManager()

    # These properties should NOT exist after Task 3.3 migration
    data_properties = [
        'track_data',
        'has_data',
        'data_bounds',
        'selected_points',
        'current_frame',  # Consumers use ApplicationState directly
        'total_frames',   # Consumers use ApplicationState directly
    ]

    for prop in data_properties:
        assert not hasattr(state_manager, prop), \
            f"StateManager should not have '{prop}' after Task 3.3 migration"

    # These UI properties SHOULD still exist
    ui_properties = [
        'zoom_level',
        'pan_offset',
        'current_tool',
        'playback_mode',
        'is_modified',
    ]

    for prop in ui_properties:
        assert hasattr(state_manager, prop), \
            f"StateManager should have UI property '{prop}'"
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents accidental re-introduction of delegation
- Documents the architectural intent
- Serves as executable documentation

### 8.6 Update Testing Strategy 🟢

**Priority**: NICE-TO-HAVE - Strengthens verification

**Additional verification commands**:
```bash
# After migration, verify no data delegation remains:
echo "Checking for remaining data delegation..."
grep -E "self\._app_state\.(get_curve_data|get_selection|current_frame|get_total_frames)" ui/state_manager.py

# Should ONLY appear in:
# 1. Signal forwarding in __init__ (if any remain)
# 2. Nowhere else (indicates complete migration)

# Verify property count reduction:
echo "Property count before: $(git show HEAD~1:ui/state_manager.py | grep -c '@property')"
echo "Property count after: $(grep -c '@property' ui/state_manager.py)"
echo "Expected reduction: ~7-10 properties removed"

# Run full type check (not just per-file):
./bpr  # Check ALL files for cross-file type issues
```

### 8.7 Consider StateManager Rename 🟢

**Priority**: LOW - Nice-to-have, not critical

**Current Name**: `StateManager` (generic)

**After Migration**: Contains UI/session state only

**Options**:
1. **Keep `StateManager`** - Simple, no breaking changes ✅ RECOMMENDED
2. Rename to `UIStateManager` - More explicit
3. Rename to `ViewPreferences` - Descriptive
4. Rename to `SessionState` - Emphasizes session metadata

**Recommendation**: **Defer to Phase 4** or future refactoring.
- Renaming is a breaking change (affects many files)
- Current name is acceptable with proper documentation
- Documentation (CLAUDE.md) already clarifies role
- Not worth the churn for this task

## 9. Comparison to PLAN TAU Requirements

### 9.1 Plan Alignment Analysis

**From plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md lines 1064-1295:**

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| ✅ REQUIRED PREPARATION (4-8 hours) | COMPLETE | Inventory, analysis, file list created |
| ✅ Manual migration (not automated) | ALIGNED | Analysis shows context-aware patterns |
| ✅ Remove ~210 lines delegation | ALIGNED | Correct scope identified |
| ⚠️ Common patterns documented | MOSTLY | Missing signal migration pattern |
| ✅ Verification steps | ALIGNED | Property count, test suite |
| ✅ Success metrics | ALIGNED | Lines removed, tests pass, single source |

**Deviations**:
1. **Signal migration not inventoried** - Supplementary grep needed (Section 8.1)
2. **total_frames API inconsistency** - Documentation vs reality mismatch (Section 8.2)

**Overall Alignment**: **90%** - Strong alignment with minor gaps.

### 9.2 Time Estimate Validation

**Original Plan**: 3-4 days
**After Preparation**: 1-1.5 days (adjusted based on 9 files, not 100+)

**Breakdown**:
- Property migration: 6 hours (9 files × 40 min avg)
- Signal migration: +1.5 hours (3 files, not originally counted)
- Testing: 2 hours
- Cleanup: 1 hour
- Buffer: 1 hour
- **Total**: 11.5 hours ≈ **1.5 days**

**Adjusted Estimate**: **1.5-2 days** (accounting for signal migration)

**Validation**: ✅ Preparation reduced scope significantly (9 files vs 100+), making task very manageable.

## 10. Final Assessment

### 10.1 Architectural Grade: B+

**Grading Breakdown**:

| Criterion | Grade | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Goal Achievement (Single Source of Truth) | A | 20% | 20 |
| SOLID Compliance | A+ | 20% | 22 |
| Hidden Coupling (Signal Gap) | B- | 15% | 10.5 |
| Idiomatic Patterns | A | 15% | 15 |
| Testing Strategy | B+ | 10% | 8.5 |
| Maintainability | A- | 10% | 9 |
| Debt Reduction | A- | 5% | 4.75 |
| Plan Alignment | A- | 5% | 4.75 |

**Total Weighted Score**: **94.5 / 110** ≈ **86%** = **B+**

**Why B+ instead of A?**
- Signal migration gap is a critical oversight that must be addressed
- total_frames API inconsistency could cause immediate errors
- Once gaps are addressed, this would be A-/A quality

**Why not lower?**
- Architectural approach is fundamentally sound
- Patterns are idiomatic and correct
- Preparation is thorough (just incomplete on signals)
- Issues identified are easily fixable

### 10.2 SOLID Compliance: A+

This migration **significantly improves** SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Perfect improvement (A+ → from two responsibilities to one)
- **Interface Segregation**: Major improvement (A → from fat interface to focused interfaces)
- **Open/Closed**: Minor improvement (B+)
- **Liskov/Dependency Inversion**: N/A or unchanged

### 10.3 Critical Concerns

**ONE SHOWSTOPPER** (must fix before implementation):
1. 🔴 **Signal migration not inventoried** - Blocks implementation until corrected

**MEDIUM-PRIORITY ISSUES** (fixable during implementation):
2. 🟡 **total_frames API inconsistency** - Easy fix, but must address
3. 🟡 **selected_points type mismatch** - Use sorted() for backward compatibility
4. 🟡 **data_bounds business logic** - Move to ApplicationState

### 10.4 Strategic Recommendations Summary

**REQUIRED (before implementation)**:
1. Complete signal inventory (Section 8.1) 🔴
2. Resolve total_frames API (Section 8.2) 🟡

**RECOMMENDED (during implementation)**:
3. Handle selected_points type mismatch (Section 8.3) 🟡
4. Move data_bounds to ApplicationState (Section 8.4) 🟡

**NICE-TO-HAVE (quality improvements)**:
5. Add verification tests (Section 8.5) 🟢
6. Strengthen testing strategy (Section 8.6) 🟢
7. Consider StateManager rename (Section 8.7) 🟢 - Defer to Phase 4

### 10.5 Long-Term Impact: A-

**Will this reduce or increase technical debt?**

**SIGNIFICANT DEBT REDUCTION**:
- Removes ~210-350 lines of delegation code
- Eliminates "two sources of truth" anti-pattern
- Removes DEPRECATED comments
- Clarifies API (ApplicationState for data, StateManager for UI)

**Minor Acceptable Trade-offs**:
- Some active_curve checking boilerplate (explicit is better than implicit)
- Direct ApplicationState access throughout UI (proper dependency)

**Net Impact**: **Major reduction in architectural debt** with minimal acceptable boilerplate.
