# Refactoring Notes - Service-Based Architecture

This document provides comprehensive information about the refactoring of the CurveEditor application to a service-based architecture.

## Overview

The CurveEditor codebase has undergone a significant architectural transformation from a utility-class based approach to a service-based architecture. This change improves code organization, maintainability, and testability while reducing code duplication and circular dependencies.

## Architectural Changes

### Before: Utility Class Approach

Prior to the refactoring, the application used a utility-class pattern where operations were grouped by domain in `*_operations.py` files. These utility classes exposed static methods that other components would call directly.

```
UI Components → Utility Classes (CurveViewOperations, ImageOperations, etc.) → Data Model
```

Key issues with this approach:
- Circular dependencies between utility classes
- Difficulty in testing operations in isolation
- Inconsistent naming and organization patterns
- Limited ability to evolve the architecture

### After: Service-Based Architecture

The refactored architecture uses a services pattern where each domain of functionality is encapsulated in a dedicated service class located in the `services/` directory.

```
UI Components → Services (CurveService, ImageService, etc.) → Data Model
```

Key improvements:
- Clear service boundaries and responsibilities
- Consistent naming pattern (`*Service`) and location (`services/` directory)
- Improved testability through better separation of concerns
- Eliminated circular dependencies
- Enhanced type hints and documentation

## Migration Process

The migration to a service-based architecture followed this phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Create service facades that forward to legacy implementations
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate functionality directly into the service classes
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance with better type hints and documentation
4. **Phase 4**: Rename legacy modules to `.deprecated` extension
5. **Phase 5**: Update imports throughout the codebase to use the new services

## Services Overview

| Service | Responsibility | Legacy Equivalent |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| `CurveService` | Curve view and point manipulation | `CurveViewOperations` |
| `ImageService` | Image sequence handling | `ImageOperations` |
| `VisualizationService` | Grid, vectors, and display features | `VisualizationOperations` |
| `CenteringZoomService` | View centering and zoom operations | `ZoomOperations` |
| `AnalysisService` | Curve data analysis and manipulation | `CurveDataOperations` |
| `HistoryService` | Undo/redo functionality | `HistoryOperations` |
| `FileService` | File loading and saving | `FileOperations` |
| `DialogService` | Dialog management | New service |
| `SettingsService` | Application settings | `SettingsOperations` |
| `InputService` | Keyboard and mouse handling | New service |

## Completed Tasks

### Structural Changes
- ✅ Created `services/` directory with proper package structure
- ✅ Implemented all service classes with comprehensive implementations
- ✅ Added proper type hints and docstrings to all service methods
- ✅ Created clear interfaces between services and UI components
- ✅ Updated all imports to use the new service-based pattern
- ✅ Renamed all legacy operations files to `.deprecated` extension

### Import Standardization
- ✅ Converted imports to use standardized pattern: `from services.X_service import XService`
- ✅ Added compatibility aliases where needed: `from services.X_service import XService as XOperations`
- ✅ Created proper deprecation warnings in legacy files
- ✅ Fixed circular imports between service modules

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated architecture documentation to reflect service-based approach
- ✅ Created detailed service documentation with usage examples
- ✅ Added implementation details for each service
- ✅ Documented import patterns for backward compatibility

## Remaining Issues

Several minor issues remain to be addressed:

1. **Legacy Import in `curve_view.py`**: Fixed an import from `centering_zoom_operations` to use `services.centering_zoom_service` instead.

2. **Debug Logging**: The codebase contains numerous debug print statements that should be cleaned up or converted to proper logging for production use.

3. **Unnecessary Duplication**: Some service methods contain duplicated code that could be further consolidated.

4. **Test Coverage**: More comprehensive tests are needed to verify the new service implementations.

## Next Steps

### Short-term
1. Continue testing the application to ensure all functionality works as expected
2. Complete test suite for all service classes
3. Replace any remaining imports from legacy operations modules
4. Clean up debug print statements and implement proper logging

### Medium-term
1. Remove `.deprecated` files once all imports are updated
2. Enhance service implementations with more robust error handling
3. Improve performance where possible
4. Add validation tools to ensure architectural compliance

### Long-term
1. Consider further modularization with explicit interfaces
2. Add comprehensive API documentation
3. Implement dependency injection for better testability
4. Evolve to a more decoupled plugin-based architecture if needed

## Conclusion

The refactoring to a service-based architecture has successfully modernized the CurveEditor codebase, making it more maintainable, testable, and extensible. While there are still some minor issues to address, the foundation is now in place for future development.
