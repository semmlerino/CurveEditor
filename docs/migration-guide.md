# Migration Guide

## Migration Complete

The unified transformation system is now fully implemented and active in the CurveEditor codebase. All legacy transformation APIs, migration steps, and manual update instructions are obsolete.

If you are using CurveEditor, you do not need to perform any further migration steps. The codebase now uses the unified APIs by default:
- `get_transform()`
- `transform_points()`
- `stable_transform_operation()`
- `install_unified_system()`

For details on using the transformation system, refer to:
- [Unified Transformation System Documentation](transformation-system.md)
- [API Reference](api-reference.md)
- Example: `services/enhanced_curve_view_integration.py`

If you encounter issues, please open an issue in the repository or consult the documentation above.
