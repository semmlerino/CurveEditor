# UI Simplification - Side Panels Removed

## Summary
Successfully removed the left (timeline) and right (properties) panels from the main window, creating a cleaner, more focused interface with the curve editor taking up the full width.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Simplification
- **Removed QSplitter**: Eliminated the 3-panel splitter layout
- **Direct layout**: Curve container now added directly to main layout
- **Full width**: Curve editor takes up entire window width

### 2. Relocated Essential Controls
Added essential controls to the toolbar:
- Frame spinbox for frame navigation
- View option checkboxes (Background, Grid, Info)

### 3. Compatibility Maintenance
Created UI elements as member variables (not added to UI) to maintain code compatibility:
- Point position spinboxes (point_x_spinbox, point_y_spinbox)
- Sliders (point_size_slider, line_width_slider, frame_slider)
- Playback buttons (play/pause, prev/next frame, first/last frame)
- Labels (total_frames_label, point_count_label, selected_count_label)
- FPS spinbox

### 4. Files Modified
- `ui/main_window.py`: Main changes to remove panels and update layout
- `ui/modernized_main_window.py`: Updated animations to only target curve_container

### 5. Benefits
- **Cleaner interface**: No distracting side panels
- **More space**: Full width for curve editing
- **Essential controls accessible**: Important controls moved to toolbar
- **Backward compatibility**: Code that references removed UI elements still works

## Layout Structure

### Before:
```
[Timeline Panel] | [Curve Editor] | [Properties Panel]
     250px            Flexible           300px
```

### After:
```
[            Curve Editor (Full Width)            ]
[         Timeline Tabs at Bottom (Preserved)     ]
```

## Toolbar Layout
```
File | Edit | Undo/Redo | Zoom | Frame: [1] | ☑ Background ☑ Grid ☑ Info
```

## Testing
- Application starts successfully without errors
- Curve editor displays properly with full width
- View options remain functional in toolbar
- Timeline tabs at bottom preserved for frame navigation
