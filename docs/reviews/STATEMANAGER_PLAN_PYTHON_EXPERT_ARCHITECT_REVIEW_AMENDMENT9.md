# StateManager Migration Plan - Python Expert Architect Review (Amendment #9)

**Reviewer**: Python Expert Architect Agent
**Document**: `docs/STATEMANAGER_COMPLETE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (Amendment #9)
**Review Date**: 2025-10-09
**Focus**: Architectural soundness, layer separation, signal design, thread safety, scalability, patterns, API design

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ⚠️ **SIGNIFICANT ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS** - The migration plan has serious design flaws that undermine its stated goals. While the intention to separate data from UI state is sound, the execution creates new problems that may be worse than the current hybrid approach.

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT EXECUTE AS WRITTEN** - Fundamental redesign required before implementation.

**Critical Finding**: The plan creates a **DUAL API PROBLEM** (lines 301-432) where both ApplicationState and StateManager provide data access, violating PEP 20 ("There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it"). This will confuse developers and create maintenance burden.

**Severity Score**: 6/10 (Major architectural flaws, but salvageable with redesign)

---

## Architectural Issues

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Dual API Violates PEP 20 (Lines 301-432)

**Problem**: Phase 0.6 adds "single-curve convenience methods" to ApplicationState that duplicate existing multi-curve API:

```python
# Lines 301-363: Creates TWO ways to do everything
def set_track_data(self, data: CurveDataInput) -> None:
    """Set data for active curve (single-curve convenience method)."""
    active_curve = self.active_curve
    self.set_curve_data(active_curve, data)  # Delegates to multi-curve

def get_track_data(self) -> CurveDataList:
    """Get data for active curve (single-curve convenience method)."""
    return self.get_curve_data(self.active_curve)

# Now developers must choose between:
state.set_track_data(data)           # Single-curve API
state.set_curve_data("Track1", data) # Multi-curve API
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
1. **Violates PEP 20**: "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it"
2. **Increases cognitive load**: Developers must learn TWO APIs for the same operation
3. **Creates ambiguity**: Which API should new code use? Both work but have different semantics
4. **Hidden coupling**: Single-curve API depends on `active_curve` state, making behavior context-dependent
5. **Testing burden**: Must test both code paths for same functionality

**Evidence From Plan**:
- Line 305: "⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE: These methods create a dual API (violates PEP 20)"
- Line 306: "Mark as deprecated immediately. Plan removal in Phase 5 (6-12 months post-migration)"
- **The plan ACKNOWLEDGES the problem but creates it anyway!**

**Impact**: This defeats the purpose of the migration. You're replacing one architectural problem (hybrid state) with another (dual API).

**Correct Solution**:
```python
# OPTION A: Multi-curve only (explicit, clear)
state.set_curve_data(state.active_curve, data)  # Explicit curve
state.get_curve_data(state.active_curve)

# OPTION B: Active curve context (if truly needed)
with state.using_curve("Track1"):
    state.set_data(data)  # Operates on contextual curve

# NO DUAL API - Pick ONE approach and stick with it
```

**Recommendation**: Remove all "convenience methods" from Phase 0.6. Require explicit curve names everywhere. This is more verbose but eliminates architectural debt.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: "Temporary" Delegation Is A Code Smell (Lines 571-599)

**Problem**: Phase 1.2 adds "TEMPORARY" delegation methods to StateManager:

```python
# Lines 577-599: Marked as "TEMPORARY - WILL BE REMOVED"
@property
def track_data(self) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    """TEMPORARY: Get track data from ApplicationState. WILL BE REMOVED."""
    return self._app_state.get_track_data()

def set_track_data(self, data: list[tuple[float, float]], mark_modified: bool = True) -> None:
    """TEMPORARY: Set track data via ApplicationState. WILL BE REMOVED."""
    self._app_state.set_track_data(data)
    if mark_modified:
        self.is_modified = True
```

**Why This Is An Anti-Pattern**:
1. **"Temporary" code tends to become permanent** - Technical debt accumulates when "temporary" fixes aren't removed
2. **No enforcement mechanism** - What ensures these get removed? Grep checks (line 793-804) are manual, not automated
3. **Migration complexity** - Requires updating ALL callers TWICE (once to delegation, once to direct ApplicationState)
4. **Increases risk** - Each update introduces bugs. Why not update callers ONCE to final state?

**Alternative Approach** (Strangler Fig Pattern):
```python
# Phase 1: Add new API alongside old (no delegation)
# OLD: state_manager.track_data
# NEW: get_application_state().get_curve_data(curve_name)

# Phase 2: Migrate callers incrementally to new API
# Use deprecation warnings: @deprecated("Use ApplicationState.get_curve_data()")

# Phase 3: Remove old API when migration complete
# No "temporary" delegation phase needed
```

**Evidence This Is Risky**:
- Line 1707: "Phase 1-2 Atomic Dependency" listed as HIGH RISK (now resolved, but shows migration complexity)
- Lines 1740-1746: Migration hotspots require MULTIPLE updates (delegation, then removal)

**Recommendation**: Skip delegation phase. Migrate callers directly to ApplicationState in Phase 1. This is harder upfront but eliminates technical debt and reduces total migration steps.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #3: Thread Safety Model Is Misleading (Lines 82-93, 162-184)

**Problem**: Plan claims ApplicationState is "thread-safe" but then contradicts itself:

```python
# Line 88-92: Claims "Thread Safety by Layer"
- **ApplicationState**: Main-thread only (enforced by `_assert_main_thread()`)
- **StateManager**: Main-thread only

# Line 92: Contradiction
**Note**: ApplicationState has a QMutex, but it ONLY protects the batch flag
```

**This Is Confusing Because**:
1. **"Thread-safe" usually means safe for multi-threaded access** - But ApplicationState is main-thread only!
2. **QMutex presence implies thread protection** - But it only protects batch flag, not data
3. **Services in background threads can't access ApplicationState directly** - They must use Qt signals (line 92)

**Why This Design Is Problematic**:
- **Qt signals are already thread-safe** - They handle cross-thread communication automatically
- **QMutex adds complexity without benefit** - If everything is main-thread only, why have a mutex at all?
- **Misleading architecture** - Developers see mutex and assume thread-safe data access (which it isn't)

**Correct Qt Threading Pattern**:
```python
# Background thread emits signal (thread-safe)
self.data_ready.emit(curve_data)

# Main thread slot receives signal (automatic queuing)
@Slot(object)
def on_data_ready(self, curve_data):
    # Now on main thread - safe to access ApplicationState
    get_application_state().set_curve_data("Track1", curve_data)
```

**Recommendation**:
1. **Remove QMutex from ApplicationState** - It's unnecessary complexity if everything is main-thread only
2. **Or make ApplicationState truly thread-safe** - Protect ALL data access with mutex, not just batch flag
3. **Clarify documentation** - Don't use "thread-safe" to describe main-thread-only code

---

### ⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL #4: Signal Payload Design Is Inefficient (Lines 1848-1849)

**Problem**: `curves_changed` signal emits entire dict of curve data:

```python
# Line 1849: ApplicationState Signals
curves_changed: Signal = Signal(dict)  # Emits dict[str, CurveDataList]
```

**Why This Is Bad**:
1. **Massive payload**: If you have 10 curves with 1000 points each, this emits 10,000+ data points
2. **Unnecessary copying**: Receivers that only care about one curve get all curves
3. **Signal storm risk**: Every curve update emits full dict, even if one curve changed

**Current Code Reality**:
Looking at actual ApplicationState implementation (from code symbols), I see:
- `curves_changed: Signal = Signal(dict)` (line 132 of application_state.py)
- This IS the current implementation

**Better Design** (Lazy Payload):
```python
# Option A: Emit only changed curve names
curves_changed: Signal = Signal(set)  # Emits set[str] of changed curves
# Receivers fetch data themselves: state.get_curve_data(curve_name)

# Option B: Emit change event object
@dataclass
class CurveChangeEvent:
    changed_curves: set[str]
    change_type: Literal["added", "modified", "deleted"]
curves_changed: Signal = Signal(object)  # Emits CurveChangeEvent
```

**Plan Mentions This** (Line 1969, Amendment #8):
> "✅ OPTIMIZATION UC1: Lazy signal payload (send `set[str]` instead of full dict) - reduces 8MB+ signals to ~100 bytes (deferred to Phase 0.4)"

**BUT**: This is marked as "deferred" with no implementation plan. This should be mandatory, not optional.

**Recommendation**: Implement lazy signal payload as PART of migration, not deferred work. The migration is the perfect time to fix this.

### ⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL #5: Fail-Fast Behavior Creates Initialization Complexity (Lines 333-341)

**Problem**: `set_track_data()` raises RuntimeError when no active curve:

```python
# Lines 333-341: Fail-fast design
def set_track_data(self, data: CurveDataInput) -> None:
    active_curve = self.active_curve
    if active_curve is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "No active curve set. This is an initialization bug. "
            "Call set_active_curve() before set_track_data()."
        )
    self.set_curve_data(active_curve, data)
```

**Why This Is Problematic**:
1. **Tight coupling to initialization order** - Requires `set_active_curve()` before `set_track_data()`
2. **Makes testing harder** - Every test must set up active curve first
3. **Breaks existing code patterns** - Current code may load data before setting active curve
4. **Error message is unhelpful** - "This is an initialization bug" blames the caller, but it's a valid use case

**When Is This Actually A Problem?**:
```python
# Valid use case that would fail:
def load_file(path):
    data = parse_file(path)  # Load data first
    state.set_track_data(data)  # CRASH - no active curve yet!
    state.set_active_curve("Track1")  # Would set it here
```

**Alternative Design** (Deferred Active Curve):
```python
def set_track_data(self, data: CurveDataInput, curve_name: str | None = None) -> None:
    """Set data for specified curve or active curve if None."""
    if curve_name is None:
        curve_name = self.active_curve
        if curve_name is None:
            # Auto-create default curve for backwards compatibility
            curve_name = "__default__"
            self.set_active_curve(curve_name)
            logger.info(f"Auto-created default curve: {curve_name}")
    self.set_curve_data(curve_name, data)
```

**Plan's Justification** (Lines 333-341):
> "Fail fast: No active curve is a BUG, not a use case"

**Counter-Argument**: This assumes all code follows a specific initialization order. Real-world code often loads data before UI state is ready. Failing fast here creates brittleness.

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Allow `curve_name` parameter with fallback to active curve (most flexible)
2. Auto-create default curve (backwards compatible)
3. Accept None and defer curve assignment until active curve is set (lazy evaluation)

---

## Pattern Problems

### ⚠️ PATTERN #1: Strangler Fig Pattern Incomplete (Phases 1-2)

**Problem**: The plan attempts Strangler Fig pattern (gradual replacement) but doesn't fully commit:

**Strangler Fig Pattern Components**:
1. ✅ **Create new abstraction** (ApplicationState methods) - Line 299-432
2. ⚠️ **Redirect old API to new** (delegation) - Lines 571-599, but marked "TEMPORARY"
3. ❌ **Gradually migrate callers** - Plan says migrate ALL at once (Phase 1.3-1.4)
4. ✅ **Remove old abstraction** - Phase 1.6

**Why This Is Incomplete**:
- **True Strangler Fig allows incremental migration** - Migrate one caller at a time, test, repeat
- **Plan requires atomic migration** - "Update ALL callers" (line 619) is risky
- **No rollback strategy** - If migration fails halfway, you're stuck

**Better Approach**:
```python
# Week 1: Add new API with deprecation warnings
@deprecated("Use ApplicationState.get_curve_data() instead")
def track_data(self):
    return self._app_state.get_track_data()

# Week 2-3: Migrate callers incrementally (file by file)
# Each PR migrates 1-3 files, runs full test suite

# Week 4: Remove deprecated API when warnings clear
```

**Recommendation**: Break Phase 1.3 into sub-phases with incremental migration. Don't attempt "update ALL callers" atomically.

---

### ⚠️ PATTERN #2: Adapter Pattern Misused (Lines 129-150)

**Problem**: `_on_app_state_selection_changed` is an adapter but adds business logic:

```python
# Lines 130-150: Adapter with filtering logic
def _on_app_state_selection_changed(self, indices: set[int], curve_name: str) -> None:
    """Adapter to forward ApplicationState selection_changed signal."""
    expected_curve = self._get_curve_name_for_selection()
    if expected_curve is None:
        logger.debug("No active curve for selection - ignoring signal")
        return
    if curve_name == expected_curve:
        self.selection_changed.emit(indices)  # Only forward if matches
```

**Why This Is Problematic**:
- **Adapter pattern should be pure translation** - No filtering or business logic
- **Hidden filtering creates confusion** - UI might not see all selection changes
- **Violates Single Responsibility** - Adapter now does translation AND filtering

**Correct Pattern**:
```python
# Pure adapter (translation only)
def _on_app_state_selection_changed(self, indices: set[int], curve_name: str) -> None:
    """Translate ApplicationState signal to StateManager signal."""
    # Pure translation: (indices, curve_name) -> indices
    self.selection_changed.emit(indices)

# Filtering in UI layer (where it belongs)
@Slot(set)
def on_selection_changed(self, indices: set[int]) -> None:
    if not self._is_relevant_curve():
        return  # UI decides what to ignore
    self._update_ui(indices)
```

**Recommendation**: Remove filtering logic from adapter. Let UI components decide what to ignore.

---

### ✅ PATTERN #3: Command Pattern Reference Is Good (Line 1796)

**Positive**: Plan references FrameChangeCoordinator as successful pattern:

```python
# Lines 1788-1805: Lessons from FrameChangeCoordinator
1. Fixed root cause (non-deterministic ordering), not symptom
2. Eliminated duplication (6 handlers → 1 coordinator)
3. Clear single responsibility
```

This is **excellent architectural thinking**. The plan correctly identifies that fixing root cause (data in wrong layer) is better than patching symptoms (adding signals).

**However**: The plan doesn't follow its own advice. It adds convenience methods (symptom patching) instead of fixing root cause (removing StateManager data access entirely).

---

## API Design Issues

### 🔴 API #1: Inconsistent Naming Conventions (Throughout)

**Problem**: Mixed naming conventions create confusion:

```python
# ApplicationState uses verb prefixes
state.get_curve_data(name)    # ✅ Consistent
state.set_curve_data(name, data)  # ✅ Consistent

# StateManager mixes styles
state_manager.track_data       # ❌ Property (no verb)
state_manager.set_track_data() # ❌ Method with verb
state_manager.has_data         # ❌ Property (boolean)
```

**PEP 8 Guidance**: Properties should be nouns, methods should be verbs. Mix creates confusion about whether something is a property or method.

**Better Consistency**:
```python
# Option A: All properties (Pythonic)
state_manager.track_data       # Property getter
state_manager.track_data = x   # Property setter

# Option B: All methods (Java-style, but consistent)
state_manager.get_track_data()
state_manager.set_track_data(x)

# Option C: Follow bool convention
state_manager.has_data         # Boolean property (OK)
state_manager.data             # Data property
state_manager.data = x         # Data setter
```

**Current Code Reality**: Looking at state_manager.py, I see:
- Line 210: `@property def track_data`
- Line 214: `def set_track_data()` (method, not setter)
- Line 235: `@property def has_data`

**This is indeed inconsistent!** Properties mixed with setter methods.

**Recommendation**: Standardize on properties with setters OR getter/setter methods throughout. Don't mix.

---

### ⚠️ API #2: Return Type Inconsistency (Lines 345-358, 418-421)

**Problem**: Some methods return copies, others return originals:

```python
# Line 210-212: Returns copy
@property
def track_data(self) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    return self._track_data.copy()

# Line 233-236: Returns copy
def image_files(self) -> list[str]:
    return self._image_files.copy()

# Line 606-609: Returns original (from ApplicationState)
@property
def active_curve(self) -> str | None:
    return self._active_curve  # No copy
```

**Why Inconsistency Is Bad**:
- **Defensive copying prevents mutation** - But only if applied consistently
- **Performance cost** - Copying large lists is expensive
- **API contract unclear** - Can caller mutate return value or not?

**Better Approach**:
```python
# Option A: Document in type system (requires Python 3.12+)
from typing import ReadOnly

@property
def track_data(self) -> ReadOnly[list[tuple[float, float]]]:
    """Returns immutable view - do not modify."""
    return self._track_data

# Option B: Return immutable types
@property
def track_data(self) -> tuple[tuple[float, float], ...]:
    """Returns immutable tuple."""
    return tuple(self._track_data)

# Option C: Clear documentation
@property
def track_data(self) -> list[tuple[float, float]]:
    """Returns defensive copy - safe to modify."""
    return self._track_data.copy()
```

**Recommendation**: Document copy behavior in docstrings and be consistent. If you copy, ALWAYS copy. If you don't, NEVER copy.

---

### ⚠️ API #3: Optional Parameters Create Ambiguity (Lines 882-900)

**Problem**: `set_image_files` has optional `directory` parameter with unclear semantics:

```python
# Lines 883-900
def set_image_files(self, files: list[str], directory: str | None = None) -> None:
    """
    Args:
        files: List of image file paths
        directory: Optional base directory (if None, keeps current)  # ⚠️ Unclear
    """
    # ...
    if directory is not None:
        self._image_directory = directory
```

**Ambiguity**: What does `directory=None` mean?
1. "Don't change current directory" (as documented)
2. "Clear the directory" (as None often means)
3. "Use default directory" (another interpretation)

**This Creates Confusion**:
```python
# What does this do?
state.set_image_files([], None)
# Clear files but keep directory? Or clear both?

# What about this?
state.set_image_files(["/a.jpg"], None)
# Files have absolute paths - why would directory matter?
```

**Better API Design**:
```python
# Option A: Separate methods
def set_image_files(self, files: list[str]) -> None:
    """Set files without changing directory."""

def set_image_directory(self, directory: str | None) -> None:
    """Set directory (None clears it)."""

# Option B: Sentinel value
from typing import Literal
KEEP_CURRENT = object()

def set_image_files(
    self,
    files: list[str],
    directory: str | None | Literal[KEEP_CURRENT] = KEEP_CURRENT
) -> None:
    """Set files and optionally directory."""
    if directory is not KEEP_CURRENT:
        self._image_directory = directory

# Option C: Explicit parameter names
def set_image_files(
    self,
    files: list[str],
    *,
    update_directory: bool = False,
    directory: str | None = None
) -> None:
    """Set files and optionally update directory."""
    if update_directory:
        self._image_directory = directory
```

**Recommendation**: Use Option A (separate methods) for clarity. Don't overload parameters with multiple meanings.

---

## Thread Safety Concerns

### ⚠️ THREAD #1: QMutex Usage Is Questionable (Lines 161-165, 969-990)

**From ApplicationState Code**:
```python
# Line 161-163: QMutex for batch flag only
self._mutex: QMutex = QMutex()
self._batch_mode: bool = False
self._pending_signals: dict = {}

# Lines 969-990: _emit() implementation
def _emit(self, signal: Signal, args: tuple) -> None:
    self._assert_main_thread()  # Enforces main thread

    self._mutex.lock()  # Why mutex if main-thread only?
    try:
        if self._batch_mode:
            self._pending_signals[signal] = args
        else:
            signal.emit(*args)
    finally:
        self._mutex.unlock()
```

**Questions**:
1. **Why mutex if main-thread only?** - `_assert_main_thread()` already ensures single-threaded access
2. **What race condition does this prevent?** - Batch mode flag can't race if only accessed from main thread
3. **Is this premature optimization?** - Mutex adds complexity without clear benefit

**Possible Explanation**: Batch mode might be set from different threads? But plan says "main-thread only"!

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Remove mutex if truly main-thread only
2. OR make ApplicationState thread-safe for all operations (protect data, not just batch flag)
3. Document exact threading invariants clearly

---

### ⚠️ THREAD #2: Signal Emission Across Threads Is Not Addressed (Line 92)

**Plan States** (Line 92):
> "Services running in background threads must use Qt signals to communicate with ApplicationState."

**Problem**: This is mentioned but not designed:
1. **How do background services get data TO ApplicationState?** - Must emit signal, but to whom?
2. **Who connects these signals?** - No connection management shown
3. **What about backpressure?** - If background thread produces data faster than main thread consumes?

**Missing Pattern**:
```python
# Background worker thread
class DataLoader(QThread):
    data_ready = Signal(str, object)  # (curve_name, data)

    def run(self):
        data = load_expensive_data()
        self.data_ready.emit("Track1", data)  # Queued connection

# Main thread connector
loader = DataLoader()
loader.data_ready.connect(
    lambda name, data: get_application_state().set_curve_data(name, data)
)
```

**Recommendation**: Add section on cross-thread signal patterns. Show complete example with background thread -> Qt signal -> ApplicationState update.

---

## Scalability Concerns

### ⚠️ SCALE #1: Curve Count Not Considered (Throughout)

**Problem**: Plan assumes "reasonable" number of curves but doesn't define limits:

```python
# Line 329: MAX_POINTS validation
MAX_POINTS = 100_000  # ✅ Good - explicit limit

# No MAX_CURVES validation!
# What if user imports 1000 curves? 10,000 curves?
```

**Impact**:
- `curves_changed` signal with dict payload becomes 10MB+ with many curves
- Selection operations iterate over all curves (O(n) where n = curve count)
- UI performance degrades without curve count limits

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Add to validation
MAX_CURVES = 1000  # Reasonable limit for UI responsiveness

def set_curve_data(self, curve_name: str, data: CurveDataInput) -> None:
    if len(self._curves_data) >= MAX_CURVES and curve_name not in self._curves_data:
        raise ValueError(f"Too many curves: {len(self._curves_data)} (max: {MAX_CURVES})")
    # ... rest of method
```

---

### ⚠️ SCALE #2: No Index Structures For Lookup (Current Code)

**Observation**: Looking at ApplicationState, I don't see spatial indices or caching for curve lookups:

```python
# Likely O(n) operations:
def get_curve_data(self, curve_name: str) -> CurveDataList:
    return self._curves_data.get(curve_name, []).copy()  # Dict lookup is O(1) ✅

# But what about:
def find_curve_at_frame(self, frame: int) -> list[str]:
    # Would need to search all curves - O(n * m)
    return [name for name, data in self._curves_data.items()
            if any(point.frame == frame for point in data)]
```

**This Is OK For Now**: Dict-based storage is appropriate for curve count < 1000.

**Future Consideration**: If app grows to 10,000+ curves, consider:
- Spatial indices for frame-based queries
- Curve visibility culling
- Lazy loading of curve data

---

## Strong Points

### ✅ STRENGTH #1: Clear Layer Separation Goal (Lines 48-70)

**Positive**: The architectural vision is sound:

```
ApplicationState (Data Layer)
├─ Curve data (track_data, curve points)
├─ Image sequence (image files, directory)
├─ Frame state (current frame, total frames)
└─ Selection state (selected curves, points)

StateManager (UI Preferences Layer)
├─ View state (zoom, pan, bounds)
├─ Tool state (current tool, smoothing params)
├─ Window state (position, sizes, fullscreen)
└─ Session state (recent directories)
```

This separation follows solid architectural principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each layer has clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns** - Data vs. UI state clearly distinguished
- **Dependency Inversion** - Higher layers depend on lower layers, not vice versa

---

### ✅ STRENGTH #2: Comprehensive Testing Strategy (Lines 1625-1682)

**Positive**: Plan includes detailed testing:

- 15+ unit tests for migration
- 8+ integration tests for signal coordination
- Regression testing (full 2100+ test suite)
- Thread safety tests
- No circular dependency tests

This is **excellent test planning** and shows maturity in architectural thinking.

---

### ✅ STRENGTH #3: Batch Update Support (Lines 858-967)

**From ApplicationState Code**:
```python
# Lines 858-967: Context manager for batching
@contextmanager
def batch_updates(self):
    """Batch multiple updates into single signal emission."""
    self.begin_batch()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        self.end_batch()
```

**Why This Is Good**:
- **Prevents signal storms** - Multiple updates → one signal
- **Performance optimization** - Reduces UI repaints
- **Clean API** - Context manager is Pythonic
- **Atomic semantics** - All-or-nothing update behavior

**This is excellent design** and should be highlighted as a pattern to follow.

---

### ✅ STRENGTH #4: Detailed Migration Hotspots (Lines 1806-1866)

**Positive**: Plan identifies exact code locations that need updates:

- `data_bounds` (state_manager.py:240-249)
- `current_frame.setter` (state_manager.py:345-358)
- `current_image` (state_manager.py:442-447)
- `reset_to_defaults` (state_manager.py:621-672)
- `get_state_summary` (state_manager.py:676-710)

This level of detail shows **thorough code analysis** and reduces migration risk.

### ✅ STRENGTH #5: Amendment Process Shows Iteration (Lines 18-44, 1906-1993)

**Positive**: Nine amendments show:
- **Willingness to iterate** - Plan improves based on feedback
- **Attention to detail** - Fixes method names, thread safety, type hints
- **Risk awareness** - Identifies blockers and resolves them

**This is how good architecture evolves** - through iteration and refinement.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)

1. **REMOVE Dual API (Phase 0.6)** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Delete all "single-curve convenience methods"
   - Require explicit `curve_name` parameters everywhere
   - Accept verbosity for architectural clarity

2. **REMOVE "Temporary" Delegation (Phase 1.2)** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Migrate callers directly to ApplicationState
   - Use deprecation warnings, not delegation
   - Reduce migration from 2 steps to 1 step

3. **FIX Thread Safety Documentation (Lines 82-93)** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Don't use "thread-safe" for main-thread-only code
   - Either remove QMutex OR make truly thread-safe
   - Add cross-thread signal pattern examples

4. **IMPLEMENT Lazy Signal Payload (Lines 1848-1849)** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - Change `curves_changed: Signal(dict)` to `Signal(set)`
   - Emit only changed curve names, not full data
   - Reduces signal payload from MB to bytes

5. **RECONSIDER Fail-Fast Active Curve (Lines 333-341)** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - Allow `curve_name` parameter as alternative
   - OR auto-create default curve for compatibility
   - Don't force specific initialization order

### Design Improvements

6. **Standardize API Naming** (Throughout)
   - Pick properties-with-setters OR getter/setter methods
   - Don't mix `@property track_data` with `def set_track_data()`
   - Follow PEP 8 conventions consistently

7. **Document Copy Semantics** (Throughout)
   - Specify whether methods return copies or originals
   - Be consistent: always copy OR never copy
   - Consider ReadOnly types (Python 3.13+)

8. **Split Multi-Purpose Parameters** (Lines 882-900)
   - Separate `set_image_files()` and `set_image_directory()`
   - Avoid optional parameters with multiple meanings
   - Make API intentions explicit

9. **Add Resource Limits** (Throughout)
   - Define MAX_CURVES (suggest 1000)
   - Validate curve count in set_curve_data()
   - Document scalability assumptions

10. **Complete Strangler Fig Pattern** (Phases 1-2)
    - Break "update ALL callers" into incremental steps
    - Migrate file-by-file with per-file testing
    - Add rollback strategy for failed migrations

### Documentation Needs

11. **Cross-Thread Communication Pattern**
    - Show background thread → Qt signal → ApplicationState
    - Document queued connection requirements
    - Provide complete working example

12. **When To Use Which API**
    - If keeping dual API, document when to use each
    - Create decision tree for developers
    - BUT: Better to remove dual API entirely

13. **Migration Guide For Developers**
    - "How to migrate my code to ApplicationState"
    - Common patterns and anti-patterns
    - Code examples for typical scenarios

---

## Conclusion

**The migration plan has the RIGHT GOAL (layer separation) but WRONG EXECUTION (dual API, temporary delegation).**

**Key Issues**:
1. 🔴 **Dual API violates PEP 20** - Creates confusion and technical debt
2. 🔴 **"Temporary" delegation is an anti-pattern** - Increases migration complexity
3. 🔴 **Thread safety model is misleading** - Main-thread-only with unnecessary mutex
4. ⚠️ **Signal payload design is inefficient** - Emits full dict instead of lazy load
5. ⚠️ **Fail-fast active curve creates brittleness** - Forces specific initialization order

**Positive Aspects**:
- ✅ Clear layer separation vision
- ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy
- ✅ Batch update support
- ✅ Detailed migration hotspots
- ✅ Iterative amendment process

**Overall Recommendation**: **DO NOT EXECUTE AS WRITTEN**

**Required Changes**:
1. Remove dual API (Phase 0.6 single-curve convenience methods)
2. Remove delegation phase (Phase 1.2) - migrate directly
3. Clarify thread safety model (remove mutex OR make fully thread-safe)
4. Implement lazy signal payload (emit changed curve names, not full dict)
5. Relax fail-fast active curve (allow explicit curve_name parameter)

**With these changes, the migration becomes architecturally sound and maintainable.**

**Estimated Rework**: 10-15 hours to redesign + test
**Estimated Savings**: 30-40 hours of future technical debt cleanup

**The extra design time upfront will save significant maintenance burden long-term.**
