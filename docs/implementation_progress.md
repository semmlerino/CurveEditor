# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the post-refactoring improvement plan for the CurveEditor application.

## Completed Tasks

### Debug Cleanup Plan Implementation

- ✅ Created `services/logging_service.py` with a comprehensive logging system
- ✅ Updated `main.py` to initialize logging at startup
- ✅ Replaced debug print statements in `curve_view.py`:
  - ✅ Converted `resetView()` to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted `setPoints()` to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted `set_image_sequence()` and related methods to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted image handling methods to use proper logging
- ✅ Replaced debug print statements in `main_window.py`:
  - ✅ Converted enhanced curve view loading messages to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted smoothing operation debug messages to use proper logging
- ✅ Created `logging_config.py` to manage logging configuration:
  - ✅ Support for JSON configuration file
  - ✅ Module-specific log levels
  - ✅ Command-line interface for configuration
  - ✅ Integration with main application startup

### Testing Plan Implementation

- ✅ Created `test_curve_service.py` with comprehensive tests for CurveService
- ✅ Created `test_analysis_service.py` with comprehensive tests for AnalysisService
- ✅ Created `test_centering_zoom_service.py` with comprehensive tests for CenteringZoomService
- ✅ Implemented `test_runner.py` script with:
  - ✅ Test discovery and execution
  - ✅ Coverage reporting capability
  - ✅ Architecture validation integration
  - ✅ Command-line options for flexibility

## In-Progress Tasks

### Debug Cleanup

- ⏳ Convert debug prints in other key files:
  - ⏳ Enhanced curve view implementation
  - ⏳ Service implementations

### Testing Expansion

- ⏳ Implement tests for remaining services:
  - ⏳ VisualizationService
  - ⏳ ImageService
  - ⏳ FileService

## Remaining Tasks

### Short-term (0-1 month)

1. **Complete Debug Cleanup**
   - Finish converting all remaining debug prints to use the logging system
   - Add documentation for the logging system and configuration options

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Complete test implementation for all services
   - Add integration tests for key workflows
   - Implement UI component tests

3. **Enhance Validation Tools**
   - Update `refactoring_validation.py` to work with the test runner
   - Add more comprehensive checks for architectural compliance

### Medium-term (1-3 months)

1. **Remove Deprecated Files**
   - Once testing confirms all functionality works, remove `.deprecated` files
   - Update any remaining legacy imports

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add consistent error handling across all services
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical code paths

## Priorities for Next Steps

1. Complete debug cleanup in other service implementations
2. Run the test runner to verify existing tests pass
3. Implement tests for VisualizationService
4. Create user documentation for the logging system
5. Add integration tests between services

## Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Debug prints cleaned | ~45% | 100% |
| Test coverage | ~35% | 80%+ |
| Services with tests | 3/10 | 10/10 |
| Architecture validation | Partial | Comprehensive |

## Conclusion

Implementation of the post-refactoring improvement plan continues to make excellent progress. The debugging infrastructure has been significantly enhanced with the addition of the logging configuration system, allowing for fine-grained control of log levels. Test coverage has been expanded to include the CenteringZoomService, which is a critical component of the application. The focus should now be on expanding test coverage to the remaining services and completing the debug cleanup throughout the codebase.
