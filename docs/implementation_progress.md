# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the post-refactoring improvement plan for the CurveEditor application.

## Completed Tasks

### Debug Cleanup Plan Implementation

- ✅ Created `services/logging_service.py` with a comprehensive logging system

- ✅ Replaced debug print statements in `curve_view.py`:
  - ✅ Converted `resetView()` to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted `setPoints()` to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted `set_image_sequence()` and related methods to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted image handling methods to use proper logging
- ✅ Replaced debug print statements in `main_window.py`:
  - ✅ Converted enhanced curve view loading messages to use proper logging
  - ✅ Converted smoothing operation debug messages to use proper logging
- ✅ Created `logging_config.py` to manage logging configuration:
  - ✅ Support for JSON configuration file
  - ✅ Module-specific log levels
  - ✅ Command-line interface for configuration
  - ✅ Integration with main application startup
- ✅ Created comprehensive `logging_guide.md` documentation
- ✅ Implemented enhanced curve view logging:
  - ✅ Converted all visualization operations to use proper logging
  - ✅ Added context-aware logging for UI interactions

### Testing Plan Implementation

- ✅ Created `test_curve_service.py` with comprehensive tests for CurveService
- ✅ Created `test_analysis_service.py` with comprehensive tests for AnalysisService
- ✅ Created `test_centering_zoom_service.py` with comprehensive tests for CenteringZoomService
- ✅ Created `test_input_service.py` with tests for keyboard and mouse handling
- ✅ Created `test_main_window.py` with initial UI component tests
- ✅ Implemented `test_runner.py` script with:
  - ✅ Test discovery and execution
  - ✅ Coverage reporting capability
  - ✅ Architecture validation integration
  - ✅ Command-line options for flexibility
- ✅ Created comprehensive `testing_guide.md` documentation

## In-Progress Tasks

### Debug Cleanup

- ⏳ Convert debug prints in other key files:
  - ✅ Enhanced curve view implementation
  - ✅ Service implementations (100% complete)
    - ✅ `visualization_service.py` debug prints converted to proper logging
      - ✅ Tests updated to verify logging calls instead of print statements
    - ✅ `image_service.py` debug prints converted to proper logging
    - ✅ `file_service.py` debug prints converted to proper logging
    - ✅ `centering_zoom_service.py` debug prints converted to proper logging
    - ✅ `settings_service.py` debug prints converted to proper logging
  - ⏳ Analysis operations and dialogs

### Testing Expansion

- ⏳ Implement tests for remaining services:
  - ✅ VisualizationService (100% complete)
    - ✅ Fixed test assertions to match new logging implementation
  - ⏳ ImageService (25% complete)
  - ⏳ FileService (20% complete)
  - ⏳ DialogService
  - ⏳ HistoryService

## Remaining Tasks

### Short-term (0-1 month)

1. **Complete Debug Cleanup**
   - Finish converting all remaining debug prints to use the logging system
   - Extend logging configuration system with environment variable support

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Complete test implementation for all services
   - Add integration tests for key workflows
   - Expand UI component tests

3. **Enhance Validation Tools**
   - Update `refactoring_validation.py` to work with the test runner
   - Add more comprehensive checks for architectural compliance

### Medium-term (1-3 months)

1. **Remove Deprecated Files**
   - ✅ Removed all `.deprecated` files from the codebase
   - ✅ Ensured no legacy imports remain in active code
   - ✅ Verified all functionality works with service-based architecture

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add consistent error handling across all services
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical code paths

## Priorities for Next Steps

1. Complete VisualizationService tests (highest priority)
2. Finish debug cleanup in analysis service implementations
3. Run the test runner with validation to verify architecture compliance
4. Implement initial tests for FileService and ImageService
5. Add integration tests between CurveService and HistoryService

## Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Debug prints cleaned | ~85% | 100% |
| Test coverage | ~55% | 80%+ |
| Services with tests | 6/10 | 10/10 |
| Architecture validation | Moderate | Comprehensive |
| Deprecated files removed | 100% | 100% |

## Conclusion

Implementation of the post-refactoring improvement plan has made significant progress. The debugging infrastructure has been greatly enhanced with the comprehensive logging system implemented across all service classes. The codebase has been cleaned up by removing all deprecated operation files, completing a key milestone in the architecture migration. Test coverage has been expanded to cover most critical services.

The focus for immediate work should be finishing the debug cleanup in the analysis and dialog-related components and completing tests for the remaining services. With these improvements, the application is steadily moving towards a more maintainable, testable architecture with improved documentation and validation tools.
