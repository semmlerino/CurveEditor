# Design Decisions

## Overview

This document records important architectural and design decisions made during the development of CurveEditor, providing context and rationale for future developers.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture

**Decision**: Organize functionality into focused service classes rather than monolithic components

**Rationale**:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each service handles one area of functionality
- Testability: Services can be tested in isolation
- Maintainability: Changes are localized to specific services
- Extensibility: New functionality can be added as new services

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic architecture: Rejected due to complexity and coupling issues
- Event-driven architecture: Considered but deemed too complex for current needs
- Component-based architecture: Similar benefits but less clear boundaries

**Example**:
```python
# Separate concerns into focused services
CurveService          # Point manipulation and selection
TransformationService # Coordinate transformations
VisualizationService  # Display and rendering
FileService          # Data persistence
```

### 2. Immutable Data Structures

**Decision**: Use immutable classes for core data structures (Transform, ViewState)

**Rationale**:
- Thread Safety: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
- Predictability: State cannot change unexpectedly
- Caching: Immutable objects can be safely cached
- Debugging: Easier to track state changes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mutable objects with careful state management: Rejected due to complexity
- Copy-on-write semantics: Too complex for the performance benefit
- Pure functional approach: Too restrictive for UI application

**Example**:
```python
# Transform objects are immutable
transform = Transform(scale=1.5, center_offset_x=10.0)
# Any modification creates a new instance
new_transform = transform.with_scale(2.0)
```

### 3. Unified Transformation System

**Decision**: Consolidate all coordinate transformations into a single, cached system

**Rationale**:
- Performance: Eliminate redundant calculations through caching
- Consistency: Single source of truth for all transformations
- Maintainability: One place to fix transformation issues
- Stability: Automatic drift detection and compensation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep multiple transformation implementations: Rejected due to inconsistency
- Simple caching on existing implementations: Insufficient for performance goals
- GPU-accelerated transformations: Overkill for current requirements

**Example**:
```python
# Single service handles all transformations with caching
transform = UnifiedTransformationService.from_curve_view(curve_view)
qt_points = UnifiedTransformationService.transform_points_qt(transform, points)
```

### 4. Static Service Methods

**Decision**: Implement services as collections of static methods rather than instance-based

**Rationale**:
- Simplicity: No need to manage service instances
- State Independence: Services don't maintain internal state
- Easy Testing: Static methods are easy to test
- Performance: No object instantiation overhead

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Singleton pattern: Added complexity without clear benefits
- Instance-based services with dependency injection: More complex setup
- Service registry pattern: Overkill for current scale

**Trade-offs**:
- Less flexibility for future extension
- Harder to mock for testing
- No encapsulation of service state

**Future Consideration**: May migrate to instance-based services as the application grows

### 5. Qt Framework Integration

**Decision**: Build UI directly on Qt rather than using wrapper frameworks

**Rationale**:
- Performance: Direct Qt access provides optimal performance
- Flexibility: Full access to Qt features and customization
- Stability: Mature framework with extensive documentation
- Platform Support: Cross-platform compatibility

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Web-based UI (Electron, etc.): Rejected due to performance requirements
- Native platform UIs: Too much development overhead
- Cross-platform frameworks (Kivy, etc.): Less mature than Qt

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Use structured exception handling with logging rather than error codes

**Rationale**:
- Clarity: Exceptions make error conditions explicit
- Debugging: Stack traces provide context
- Composability: Exceptions can be caught and re-raised at appropriate levels
- Integration: Works well with Python's exception system

**Example**:
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except RecoverableError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Recoverable error: {e}")
    result = fallback_operation()
except FatalError as e:
    logger.error(f"Fatal error: {e}")
    raise
```

### 2. Logging Approach

**Decision**: Use structured logging with contextual information

**Rationale**:
- Debugging: Rich context helps diagnose issues
- Monitoring: Structured data enables automated analysis
- Performance: Logging can be disabled in production
- Standardization: Consistent logging across the application

**Example**:
```python
logger.info("Point moved", extra={
    'point_index': index,
    'old_position': (old_x, old_y),
    'new_position': (new_x, new_y)
})
```

### 3. Type Annotations

**Decision**: Use comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase

**Rationale**:
- Documentation: Types serve as inline documentation
- IDE Support: Better autocomplete and error detection
- Static Analysis: Tools like mypy can catch errors
- Maintainability: Easier to understand interfaces

**Example**:
```python
def transform_points(
    curve_view: CurveViewProtocol,
    points: List[Tuple[float, float]]
) -> List[QPointF]:
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests with pytest

**Rationale**:
- Confidence: Tests enable safe refactoring
- Documentation: Tests show how APIs should be used
- Regression Prevention: Catch breaking changes early
- Performance: Benchmark tests track performance

**Test Categories**:
- Unit tests for individual service methods
- Integration tests for service interactions
- UI tests for user interaction simulation
- Performance tests for critical paths

### 5. Configuration Management

**Decision**: File-based configuration with runtime overrides

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility: Settings can be modified without code changes
- Deployment: Different configurations for different environments
- User Preferences: Allow user customization
- Defaults: Sensible defaults for new installations

**Example**:
```python
# Default settings with file-based overrides
settings = SettingsService.load_settings('config.json')
settings.update_from_environment()
```

## Data Flow Decisions

### 1. Event Handling

**Decision**: Use Qt's signal-slot mechanism for loose coupling

**Rationale**:
- Decoupling: Components don't need direct references
- Flexibility: Multiple listeners can respond to events
- Thread Safety: Qt handles cross-thread communication
- Standard Pattern: Familiar to Qt developers

**Example**:
```python
# Emit signals for state changes
self.point_moved.emit(index, new_x, new_y)

# Connect to handlers in other components
curve_view.point_moved.connect(history_service.record_move)
```

### 2. State Management

**Decision**: Distributed state with clear ownership

**Rationale**:
- Performance: No central state bottleneck
- Simplicity: Each component manages its own state
- Isolation: State changes don't affect unrelated components
- Qt Integration: Works well with Qt's object model

**State Ownership**:
- CurveView: Visual state (zoom, pan, selection)
- Data models: Business logic state
- Services: Stateless (algorithmic only)

### 3. File Format

**Decision**: Support multiple file formats with pluggable readers/writers

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility: Users can work with different data sources
- Future-proofing: Easy to add new formats
- Standards Compliance: Support industry-standard formats
- Backward Compatibility: Maintain support for legacy formats

**Supported Formats**:
- CSV: Simple, widely supported
- JSON: Structured data with metadata
- Binary: Performance-optimized format

## Performance Decisions

### 1. Rendering Strategy

**Decision**: Immediate mode rendering with selective updates

**Rationale**:
- Simplicity: Easier to implement and debug
- Qt Integration: Matches Qt's painting model
- Flexibility: Easy to add visual effects
- Performance: Adequate for typical use cases

**Optimizations**:
- Batch transformations to reduce calculations
- Cache frequently used objects
- Use Qt's built-in optimizations

### 2. Memory Management

**Decision**: Rely on Python's garbage collection with careful reference management

**Rationale**:
- Simplicity: Automatic memory management
- Safety: Reduces memory leaks
- Qt Integration: Works well with Qt's object lifecycle
- Performance: Adequate for application requirements

**Best Practices**:
- Avoid circular references
- Use weak references where appropriate
- Clear large data structures explicitly

### 3. Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Intelligent caching with automatic size management

**Rationale**:
- Performance: Eliminate redundant calculations
- Memory Control: Automatic cache eviction prevents unbounded growth
- Transparency: Caching is invisible to callers
- Configurability: Cache size can be tuned for different scenarios

**Example**:
```python
# Automatic caching with size limits
cache = LRUCache(maxsize=100)
transform = cache.get_or_create(key, factory_function)
```

## Security Decisions

### 1. Input Validation

**Decision**: Validate all external inputs at system boundaries

**Rationale**:
- Security: Prevent injection attacks
- Reliability: Catch malformed data early
- User Experience: Provide clear error messages
- Data Integrity: Ensure internal consistency

**Validation Points**:
- File loading: Validate format and content
- User input: Sanitize UI inputs
- API calls: Validate parameters

### 2. Error Information

**Decision**: Limit error information in production builds

**Rationale**:
- Security: Avoid leaking sensitive information
- User Experience: Provide understandable messages
- Debugging: Detailed information in development

**Implementation**:
- Different error messages for development vs. production
- Sensitive information only in debug logs
- Stack traces hidden from end users
