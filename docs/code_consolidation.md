# Code Consolidation Summary

This document outlines the code consolidation steps taken to complete the transition to a service-based architecture.

## Operations Files Consolidation

All legacy operations files have been properly deprecated and processed:

| Legacy File | Status | Replacement |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `curve_view_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/curve_service.py` |
| `visualization_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/visualization_service.py` |
| `centering_zoom_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/centering_zoom_service.py` |
| `settings_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/settings_service.py` |
| `history_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/history_service.py` |
| `curve_data_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/analysis_service.py` |
| `curve_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/analysis_service.py` |
| `file_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/file_service.py` |
| `image_operations.py` | Renamed to `.deprecated` | `services/image_service.py` |

## Import Standardization

The import pattern has been standardized across the application:

```python
# Old pattern (now deprecated)
from visualization_operations import VisualizationOperations
from centering_zoom_operations import ZoomOperations

# New pattern
from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService
from services.centering_zoom_service import CenteringZoomService

# Backward-compatible pattern (for transition)
from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService as VisualizationOperations
from services.centering_zoom_service import CenteringZoomService as ZoomOperations
```

## Circular Dependencies Resolution

Circular dependencies between services have been resolved:

1. **CurveService** - No longer imports from legacy operations files
   - Changed `from centering_zoom_operations import ZoomOperations` to `from services.centering_zoom_service import CenteringZoomService as ZoomOperations`
   - Changed `from visualization_operations import VisualizationOperations` to `from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService as VisualizationOperations`

2. **Other Services** - Import directly from other services rather than through legacy files

## Deprecation Warnings

All deprecated files now include:

1. Clear docstring indicating deprecation status
2. Explicit warning when imported using `warnings.warn()`
3. Instructions for updating imports
4. Proper forwarding to service implementations

Example deprecation pattern:

```python
"""
DEPRECATED: This module has been migrated to services/visualization_service.py
Please update your imports to use:
    from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService as VisualizationOperations

This file is kept only for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future version.
"""

import warnings
warnings.warn(
    "The visualization_operations module is deprecated. "
    "Please use 'from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService' instead.",
    DeprecationWarning,
    stacklevel=2
)

from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService

class VisualizationOperations:
    """DEPRECATED: Visualization operations for the CurveEditor."""
    # Forward all static methods
    for name, fn in VisualizationService.__dict__.items():
        if callable(fn) and not name.startswith('__'):
            locals()[name] = staticmethod(getattr(VisualizationService, name))
```

## Import Fixes

After renaming the legacy operations files, some import errors needed to be addressed:

1. **curve_view.py** had to be updated to use service imports:
   - Changed `from centering_zoom_operations import ZoomOperations` to `from services.centering_zoom_service import CenteringZoomService as ZoomOperations`

2. **main_window.py** also needed import updates:
   - Changed `from centering_zoom_operations import ZoomOperations` to `from services.centering_zoom_service import CenteringZoomService as ZoomOperations`
   - Changed `from curve_data_operations import CurveDataOperations` to `from services.analysis_service import AnalysisService as CurveDataOperations`

3. **services/dialog_service.py** had legacy import:
   - Changed `from curve_data_operations import CurveDataOperations` to `from services.analysis_service import AnalysisService as CurveDataOperations`

4. **services/analysis_service.py** had circular dependency:
   - Removed `from curve_data_operations import CurveDataOperations as LegacyCurveDataOps`
   - Created internal `CurveDataProcessor` class to replace functionality
   - Updated all methods to use the new processor class
   - Fixed `create_processor` method signature that was still referencing `LegacyCurveDataOps`

5. **enhanced_curve_view.py** had several legacy imports:
   - Updated multiple instances of `from visualization_operations import VisualizationOperations` to use the service import
   - Changed to `from services.visualization_service import VisualizationService as VisualizationOperations`
   - Fixed imports in setPoints, toggleGrid, toggleVelocityVectors, toggleAllFrameNumbers, toggleBackgroundVisible, setBackgroundOpacity, and set_point_radius methods

These types of import fixes are a necessary part of the consolidation process and should be expected when refactoring a codebase.

## Next Steps

The code consolidation phase is now complete. Recommended next steps include:

1. **Thorough Testing**
   - Run the application to ensure it loads correctly
   - Verify all functionality still works as expected
   - Make sure no more import errors occur during runtime

2. **Removing Deprecated Files**
   - Once all code is verified to use the new service imports, deprecated files can be entirely removed

3. **Service Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive tests for all service classes

4. **Further Import Cleanup**
   - Convert any remaining backward-compatible imports to direct service imports
