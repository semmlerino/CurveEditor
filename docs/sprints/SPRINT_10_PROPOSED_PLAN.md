# Sprint 10: Integration & Stability - Proposed Plan

## Sprint Overview

**Theme**: "Making Everything Work Together Reliably"
**Duration**: 5 days
**Priority**: Stabilization over new features

## Current State Assessment

### Test Suite Status
- **Total Tests**: 487
- **Passing**: 364 (75%)
- **Failing**: 123 (25%)
- **Main Issues**: Integration tests, outdated fixtures, Sprint 8 changes

### Coverage Status
- **Overall**: 30%
- **Services**: 27%
- **Target**: 50% (realistic from Sprint 9 lessons)

### Technical Debt

5. ⭐ Clean up deprecation warnings

### Stretch Goals (Nice to Have)
1. 🎯 100% of tests passing
2. 🎯 60% test coverage
3. 🎯 Type checking in CI/CD
4. 🎯 Automated dependency updates

## 5-Day Implementation Plan

### Day 1: Test Triage & Quick Fixes
**Goal**: Understand failures and fix easy ones

#### Morning (4 hours)
1. **Categorize all 123 failing tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --tb=short > test_failures.txt
   ```
   - Group by failure type
   - Identify common patterns
   - List required fixes

2. **Fix simple failures** (estimate 30-40 tests)
   - Mock configuration issues
   - Import errors
   - Assertion updates

#### Afternoon (4 hours)
3. **Set up basic CI/CD**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/tests.yml
   name: Tests
   on: [push, pull_request]
   ```

4. **Document failure patterns**
   - Create TEST_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md
   - List root causes

---

### Day 3: Integration Test Repair
**Goal**: Fix service interaction tests

#### Focus Areas
1. **Service Integration Tests**
   ```python

### Day 4: Coverage Expansion
**Goal**: Reach 50% coverage with quality tests

#### Priority Services for Coverage
1. **data_service.py** (17% → 50%)
   - File operations
   - Data validation
   - Error handling

2. **ui_service.py** (24% → 50%)
   - Dialog operations
   - Status updates
   - UI state management

3. **interaction_service.py** (25% → 50%)
   - User interactions
   - Point manipulation
   - Selection handling

#### Test Categories to Add
```python
# tests/test_coverage_expansion.py
class TestCriticalPaths:
    def test_complete_edit_workflow():
        """Load, edit, save cycle."""

    def test_error_recovery():
        """Graceful error handling."""

    def test_edge_cases():
        """Boundary conditions."""
```

**Day 4 Deliverables**:
- 50% overall coverage

   - Coverage reporting
   - Coverage gates (45% minimum)
   ```

2. **Add badges to README**
   - Test status
   - Coverage percentage
   - Build status

#### Afternoon (4 hours)
3. **Final validation**
   - Run all tests
   - Check coverage
   - Verify CI/CD
   - Update documentation

4. **Create Sprint 10 summary**
   - Metrics achieved
   - Lessons learned
   - Next steps

**Day 5 Deliverables**:

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Too many test failures to fix**
   - Mitigation: Focus on categories, not individual tests
   - Fallback: Document unfixable tests for Sprint 11

2. **Coverage goal unrealistic**
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical paths
   - Fallback: Accept 40-45% if quality is good

3. **CI/CD complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate
   - Fallback: Basic test running is enough

4. **Time constraints**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize must-haves
   - Fallback: Move nice-to-haves to Sprint 11

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Success (Must Achieve)
- [ ] 400+ tests passing (>82%)
- [ ] 40% test coverage
- [ ] Basic CI/CD running
- [ ] Critical integration tests fixed

### Target Success (Should Achieve)
- [ ] 440+ tests passing (>90%)
- [ ] 50% test coverage

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Focus | Tests Fixed | Coverage | Goal |
|-----|-------|-------------|----------|------|
| 1 | Triage & Quick Fixes | 40 | 30% | Understanding |
| 2 | Fixture Modern | 20 | 32% | Infrastructure |
| 3 | Integration | 30 | 35% | Interactions |
| 4 | Coverage | 10 | 50% | Quality tests |
| 5 | CI/CD & Valid | 0 | 50% | Automation |

**Total**: 100 tests fixed, 20% coverage increase

## Lessons from Sprint 9 Applied

### What We're Doing Differently
1. **Realistic goals** - 50% not 80% coverage
2. **Flexible planning** - Can pivot if needed
3. **Quality focus** - Better tests, not more tests
4. **Early CI/CD** - Day 1, not Day 7
5. **Documentation throughout** - Not just at end

### What We're Keeping
1. Daily progress tracking
2. Clear deliverables
3. Risk mitigation plans
4. Pragmatic approach
5. Value over metrics

## Tools & Commands

### Daily Commands
```bash
# Check test status
pytest tests/ --tb=no | tail -5
