- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] UI/UX testing
- [ ] Integration testing

#### Afternoon Tasks
- [ ] Fix any discovered issues
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Final quality check

#### Deliverables
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete
- Release candidate ready

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Application startup: <500ms
- Transform operations: <10ms for 1000 points
- Render cycle: 60 FPS minimum
- Memory usage: <100MB for typical session
- File load time: <1s for 10,000 points

### Quality Targets
- Test pass rate: >85%
- Zero critical bugs
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for user actions
- Documentation coverage: 100% of public APIs

### Production Readiness
- Docker container builds successfully
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Monitoring in place
- Deployment documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance regressions**: Run benchmarks after each optimization
2. **UI breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
3. **Deployment issues**: Test in staging environment

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined objectives
2. **Unexpected bugs**: Use bonus 2.5 days if needed
3. **Integration issues**: Test continuously

## Bonus Time Usage (2.5 days available)

If ahead of schedule:
1. Additional performance optimizations
2. Extra UI polish
3. More comprehensive testing

If behind schedule:
1. Use for critical bug fixes
2. Complete must-have features
3. Ensure production readiness

## Technology Stack

### Performance Tools
- cProfile for Python profiling
- memory_profiler for memory analysis
- pytest-benchmark for performance tests
- Qt Performance Monitor

### UI/UX Tools
- Qt Designer for layouts
- Modern theme frameworks
- Animation libraries
- Responsive design patterns

### Deployment Tools
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Sentry for error tracking
- Prometheus for monitoring

## Daily Standups

Each day starts with:
1. Review previous day's achievements
2. Identify blockers
3. Adjust plan if needed
4. Update metrics
