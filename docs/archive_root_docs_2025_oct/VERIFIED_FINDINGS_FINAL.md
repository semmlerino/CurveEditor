## üî¥ CRITICAL DISCOVERY

### Commit 51c500e Verified (Oct 14, 2025)

**Finding**: Qt.QueuedConnection was **intentionally added 5 days ago** to fix nested execution bug.

**Commit Message**:
> "Root cause was synchronous nested execution when coordinator executed inside TimelineController's event handler."
>
> "With QueuedConnection, coordinator runs AFTER input handler completes, preventing Qt widget state machine confusion."

**This Means**: We have **TWO CONFLICTING BUGS**:

1. **Bug #1 (Oct 14)**: Nested execution during slider drag
   - **Symptom**: Timeline disconnects from curve during slider interaction
   - **Fix**: Add Qt.QueuedConnection ‚úÖ FIXED

2. **Bug #2 (Oct 19)**: Centering lag during scrubbing
   - **Symptom**: Visual jumps, delayed centering
   - **Cause**: Qt.QueuedConnection (the fix for Bug #1!)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: **The fix for Bug #1 CREATED Bug #2!**

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED CONSENSUS FINDINGS (All 4 Agents)

### Finding 1: Qt.QueuedConnection Causes Current Bug ‚úÖ

**Verified**: `ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py:111`
```python
Qt.QueuedConnection,  # ‚Üê Causes async queue buildup
```

**Impact**: Mixed sync/async execution creates desynchronization
- Timeline: DirectConnection (synchronous)
- Coordinator: QueuedConnection (asynchronous)
- Result: Visual lag during rapid scrubbing

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

---

### Finding 2: Tests Bypass Signal Chain ‚úÖ

**Verified**: `tests/test_centering_toggle.py:93`
```python
widget.on_frame_changed(2)  # Direct call, bypasses signal chain
```

**Impact**: Tests validate centering logic but not signal delivery timing. Why all 2439+ tests pass but production fails.

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

---

### Finding 3: Coordinator's Background Justification is FALSE ‚úÖ

**Coordinator Claims** (frame_change_coordinator.py:27-30):
> "Background loading might happen AFTER centering, causing the centering calculation to use old background dimensions."

**Code Reality** (view_camera_controller.py:272):
```python
widget_center = QPointF(self.widget.width() / 2, self.widget.height() / 2)
# ^^^ Uses WIDGET dimensions, NOT background dimensions
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ CODE VERIFIED - Claim is definitively false

---

### Finding 4: StateManager Forwarding is Redundant ‚úÖ

**Verified**: `ui/state_manager.py:70`
```python
_ = self._app_state.frame_changed.connect(self.frame_changed.emit)
```

**Impact**: Unnecessary indirection, complicates debugging.

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

---

### Finding 5: Atomic Capture is Defensive, NOT Primary Fix ‚úÖ

**What atomic capture solves**:
- Curve switching during handler execution (defensive)

**What it DOESN'T solve**:
- Stale frame parameters from QueuedConnection queue

**Verified**: `view_camera_controller.py:326,332`
```python
def center_on_frame(self, frame: int) -> None:
    if not self.widget.curve_data:  # ‚Üê Re-fetches internally
        return
    position = data_service.get_position_at_frame(self.widget.curve_data, frame)
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Capturing curve_data that's never used is YAGNI violation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CORRECTED SINGLE-AGENT FINDINGS

### Finding 6: TimelineTabWidget Connection (Agent 1) - PARTIALLY CORRECT

**Agent 1 Claim**: TimelineTabWidget doesn't connect to frame_changed

**Code Reality**:
- ‚ùå WRONG METHOD: `_connect_signals()` (lines 362-367) doesn't connect to frame_changed
- ‚úÖ CORRECT METHOD: `set_state_manager()` (line 301) **DOES** connect to StateManager.frame_changed

**Verified**: `ui/timeline_tabs.py:301`
```python
_ = state_manager.frame_changed.connect(self._on_frame_changed)
```

**Conclusion**: TimelineTabWidget **DOES** connect to frame_changed via StateManager. Plan's Phase 1.3 to change connection from StateManager to ApplicationState is valid.

**Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED - Plan is correct, Agent 1 looked at wrong method

---

### Finding 7: Only ONE QueuedConnection (Agent 4) - INCORRECT

**Agent 4 Claim**: Only one QueuedConnection in entire codebase

**Code Reality**: **5 QueuedConnections** in production code:
1. `image_sequence_browser.py:1103` - Worker signal (cross-thread) ‚úÖ CORRECT
2. `image_sequence_browser.py:1104` - Worker signal (cross-thread) ‚úÖ CORRECT
3. `image_sequence_browser.py:1105` - Worker signal (cross-thread) ‚úÖ CORRECT
4. `image_sequence_browser.py:1106` - Worker signal (cross-thread) ‚úÖ CORRECT
5. `frame_change_coordinator.py:111` - Frame signal (same-thread) ‚ùå THE PROBLEM

**Conclusion**: Agent 4's count was wrong, BUT the key insight is still valid - coordinator line 111 is the **ONLY problematic** QueuedConnection.

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY CORRECT - Wrong count, right conclusion

---

## üéØ FINAL RESOLUTION: The Dilemma

### The Problem

We have **TWO MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE bugs**:

```
WITHOUT QueuedConnection (DirectConnection):
‚úÖ Bug #2 fixed: No centering lag, immediate response
‚ùå Bug #1 returns: Nested execution, slider desynchronization

WITH QueuedConnection:
‚ùå Bug #2 exists: Centering lag, visual jumps (current state)
‚úÖ Bug #1 fixed: No nested execution, slider works
```

**We cannot fix both bugs by simply removing/adding QueuedConnection!**

---

## üí° THE REAL SOLUTION

### Option 1: Signal Blocking (Prevents Nested Execution)

```python
def on_frame_changed(self, frame: int) -> None:
    # Block re-entrancy
    if self._handling_frame_change:
        return

    self._handling_frame_change = True
    try:
        # ... do work ...
    finally:
        self._handling_frame_change = False
```

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Fixes Bug #2: Synchronous execution (no lag)
- ‚úÖ Prevents Bug #1: Blocks nested calls
- ‚úÖ Risk: Low

---

### Option 2: Event Coalescing (Reduce Queue Buildup)

```python
def on_frame_changed(self, frame: int) -> None:
    # Skip redundant updates
    if frame == self._last_processed_frame:
        return
    self._last_processed_frame = frame

    # ... do work ...
```

**Effect**:
- ‚öñÔ∏è Reduces Bug #2: Fewer queued updates
- ‚úÖ Keeps Bug #1 fixed: QueuedConnection remains
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: May not fully eliminate lag

---

### Option 3: Hybrid (Keep Coordinator, Fix Connection) - RECOMMENDED

**From Agent 3 (3/4 agents recommend)**:

1. **Remove QueuedConnection** from coordinator (fix Bug #2)
2. **Add signal blocking** to prevent re-entrancy (prevent Bug #1)
3. **Keep coordinator pattern** (testability, explicit coordination)
4. **Remove StateManager forwarding** (architectural improvement)
5. **Add integration test** (close test gap)

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Fixes Bug #2: Synchronous execution
- ‚úÖ Prevents Bug #1: Signal blocking guards
- ‚úÖ Architectural improvement
- ‚úÖ Time: 1.5 hours (vs 3-5 for full removal)

---

## üìã PRIORITIZED ROADMAP (Updated with Git History)

### Phase 0.0: Git History Analysis (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

- ‚úÖ Verified commit 51c500e exists
- ‚úÖ Confirmed QueuedConnection added to fix nested execution
- ‚úÖ Understood Bug #1 vs Bug #2 conflict

**Decision**: Must add re-entrancy protection when removing QueuedConnection

---

### Phase 0.1: Foundation & Validation (1-2 hours)

**Tasks**:
1. Add integration test using `ApplicationState.set_frame()` (not direct calls)
2. Test should FAIL with current QueuedConnection (proves Bug #2 exists)
3. Add curve data to test (currently missing)
4. Add pan offset assertions to detect visual jumps
5. Document memory management strategy

**Critical Enhancement** (from Agent 1):
```python
# Load curve data (CRITICAL: missing in plan)
test_data = [(i, 100.0 + i, 200.0 + i) for i in range(1, 101)]
app_state.set_curve_data("Track1", test_data)
app_state.set_active_curve("Track1")

# Track pan offsets to detect jumps
pan_history = []
for frame in range(1, 101):
    app_state.set_frame(frame)
    qtbot.wait(10)
    pan_history.append((curve_widget.pan_offset_x, curve_widget.pan_offset_y))

# Verify smooth changes (no jumps)
for i in range(1, len(pan_history)):
    prev_x, prev_y = pan_history[i - 1]
    curr_x, curr_y = pan_history[i]
    x_delta = abs(curr_x - prev_x)
    y_delta = abs(curr_y - prev_y)
    assert x_delta < 50, f"X jumped {x_delta:.2f}px"
    assert y_delta < 50, f"Y jumped {y_delta:.2f}px"
```

### Phase 1: Fix Coordinator Connection (30 min)

**Tasks**:
1. **Remove QueuedConnection** from coordinator
2. **Add re-entrancy guard** to prevent nested execution:
   ```python
   class FrameChangeCoordinator:
       def __init__(self, main_window):
           self._handling_frame_change = False  # Re-entrancy guard

       def on_frame_changed(self, frame: int) -> None:
           # Prevent nested execution (guards against Bug #1)
           if self._handling_frame_change:
               logger.debug(f"Skipping nested frame change to {frame}")
               return

           self._handling_frame_change = True
           try:
               # ... existing logic ...
           finally:
               self._handling_frame_change = False
   ```
3. **Connect directly to ApplicationState** (not StateManager)
4. **Update docstring** (remove false background justification)

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Fixes Bug #2 (centering lag)
- ‚úÖ Prevents Bug #1 (nested execution blocked)
- ‚úÖ Integration test should PASS

---

### Phase 2: Remove StateManager Forwarding (30 min)

**Tasks**:
1. Remove `self._app_state.frame_changed.connect(self.frame_changed.emit)` from StateManager
2. Delete `frame_changed = Signal(int)` from StateManager
3. Update TimelineTabWidget connection (verified exists at line 301)
4. Update documentation

**Note**: TimelineTabWidget DOES connect to StateManager.frame_changed (verified line 301), so Phase 1.3 update is valid.

---

### Phase 3: Add Integration Test & Validate (30 min)

**Tasks**:
1. Integration test from Phase 0.1 should now PASS
2. Run full test suite
3. Type checking
4. Manual testing (slider interaction, rapid scrubbing)

## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Choose Hybrid Approach** (Agent 3's Alternative 2):

1. ‚úÖ **Keep coordinator** (3/4 agents recommend, valid Qt pattern)
2. ‚úÖ **Remove QueuedConnection** (fixes Bug #2)
3. ‚úÖ **Add re-entrancy guard** (prevents Bug #1)
4. ‚úÖ **Remove StateManager forwarding** (architectural improvement)
5. ‚úÖ **Add integration test** (closes test gap)

**Time**: 1.5 hours (vs 3-5 for full removal)
**Risk**: Low (re-entrancy guard prevents Bug #1)
**Agent Consensus**: 3/4 agents recommend keeping coordinator

---

## üö® CRITICAL TAKEAWAYS

1. **Removing QueuedConnection is NOT ENOUGH** - Must add re-entrancy protection
2. **Coordinator pattern is NOT the problem** - QueuedConnection usage is
3. **Git history was CRITICAL** - Revealed Bug #1 vs Bug #2 conflict
4. **Agent 2 was RIGHT** - QueuedConnection was intentionally added
5. **Tests have GAP** - Never exercise actual signal chain
6. **Background justification is FALSE** - Execution order doesn't matter
7. **Atomic capture is YAGNI** - center_on_frame() re-fetches curve_data

---

**Verification Complete** ‚úÖ
**Confidence**: VERY HIGH (all claims verified with code + git history)
**Next Step**: Update plan with re-entrancy guard + verified fixes
