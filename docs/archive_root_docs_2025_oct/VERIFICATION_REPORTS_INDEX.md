## Key Findings Summary

### 1. God Objects Confirmed

All three components identified in REFACTORING_PLAN.md are confirmed to be god objects:

1. **InteractionService** (1,713 lines, 84 methods)
   - WORST god object (highest complexity)
   - Mixes 5 distinct concerns
   - Priority: #1 - START HERE
   - Effort: 2 weeks

2. **CurveViewWidget** (2,004 lines, 102 methods)
   - HIGH priority god object (largest)
   - Mixes 4 concerns
   - Priority: #2
   - Effort: 1 week (depends on #1)

3. **MainWindow** (1,254 lines, 101 methods)
   - MEDIUM priority god object (well-organized)
   - 4 concerns but justified for UI coordination
   - Priority: #3
   - Effort: 1 week (optional)

### 2. Critical Insight

**While CurveViewWidget has most lines (2,004), InteractionService has highest *complexity***

Why? InteractionService mixes 5 distinct concerns:
- Mouse/pointer event handling (15 methods)
- Selection management (12 methods)
- Command history/undo (12 methods)
- Point manipulation (10 methods)
- Geometry calculations (8 methods)

This makes it the true priority for refactoring, despite having fewer lines.

### 3. Execution Roadmap

**Total Effort**: 4 weeks (with stabilization between phases)

- **Phase 3.1** (2 weeks): InteractionService → 5 specialized services
- **Phase 3.2** (1 week): CurveViewWidget → 3 components
- **Phase 3.3** (1 week): MainWindow → 60 methods (optional)

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this index and primary reports
2. **Decide** on Phase 3 execution:
   - ✅ Proceed (most impact)

   - ⚠️ Partial (e.g., only Phase 3.3 MainWindow)
3. **If proceeding**: Create detailed Phase 3.1 design document
4. **Implement**: Follow execution roadmap
5. **Monitor**: Stabilization period (2+ weeks before next phase)
