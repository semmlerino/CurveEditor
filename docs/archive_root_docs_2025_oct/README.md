# Root Documentation Archive - October 2025

This archive contains documentation from completed refactoring work and verification efforts from the StateManager Simplified Migration and related projects.

## Archive Date
October 22, 2025

## Reason for Archiving
These files are artifacts from completed work:
- StateManager Simplified Migration (Phase 1-4)
- KISS/DRY Implementation
- Various verification, validation, and audit reports
- Task-specific implementation notes
- Sprint summaries and planning documents

The refactoring work is complete and these documents served their purpose during development but are no longer needed for day-to-day reference.

## What Remains in Root

- `CLAUDE.md` - Main development guide (actively updated)
