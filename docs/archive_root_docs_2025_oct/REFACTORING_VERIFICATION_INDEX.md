## How to Use This Verification

### If You're Managing the Refactoring
1. Read VERIFICATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md first
2. Review the corrections needed section
3. Use VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.txt for quick reference during execution
4. Share findings with team

### If You're Implementing Task 1.3
1. Read DUPLICATION_VERIFICATION_DETAILS.md - TASK 1.3 section
2. Verify lines 139-146 and 193-200 in point_editor_controller.py
3. Implement QSignalBlocker helper method
4. Replace duplicated code with single method call

### If You're Implementing Task 1.5
1. Read VERIFICATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - Task 1.5 section
2. Note the corrected line numbers: 183-187, 420-424, 742-745
3. Read DUPLICATION_VERIFICATION_DETAILS.md - TASK 1.5 section
4. Implement _find_point_index_at_frame() helper
5. Replace all 3 occurrences

### If You're Implementing Task 2.1
1. Read VERIFICATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - Task 2.1 section
2. Note: Actual scope is 60+ not 15+
3. Plan for increased timeline (1-2 days vs 1 day)
4. Consider breaking into focused changes by layer
5. Use REFACTORING_PLAN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md for complete scope
