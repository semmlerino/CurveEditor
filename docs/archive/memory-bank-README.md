# Memory Bank Archive

The memory-bank directory contained tracking files used during active development. These files have been superseded by the consolidated documentation structure.

## Archived Memory Bank Files

### activeContext.md
Tracked current project status, goals, and open questions. This information is now captured in:
- [design-decisions.md](../design-decisions.md) for decision rationale
- [refactoring-history.md](../refactoring-history.md) for change tracking
- Project issues in the repository for open questions

### decisionLog.md
Recorded development decisions. This information has been consolidated into:
- [design-decisions.md](../design-decisions.md) for architectural decisions
- [refactoring-history.md](../refactoring-history.md) for refactoring decisions

### productContext.md
Captured product requirements and context. This information is now in:
- [README.md](../README.md) for project overview
- [architecture.md](../architecture.md) for technical context

### progress.md
Tracked task completion and progress. This information is preserved in:
- [refactoring-history.md](../refactoring-history.md) for completed work
- Project management tools for ongoing tasks

### systemPatterns.md
Documented code patterns and conventions. This information is now in:
- [architecture.md](../architecture.md) for architectural patterns
- [design-decisions.md](../design-decisions.md) for pattern rationale

## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Scattered Information**: Important information was spread across multiple tracking files
2. **Inconsistent Updates**: Not all files were kept current during development
3. **Poor Discoverability**: Information was hard to find for new developers
4. **Duplication**: Some content overlapped between files

## Current Documentation Approach

The new documentation structure provides:
- **Clear Organization**: Purpose-built documents for specific needs
- **Complete Coverage**: All important information captured and organized
- **Better Maintenance**: Fewer files that are easier to keep updated
- **User-Focused**: Documentation organized by user needs (quick start, API reference, etc.)

For historical context, these archived files remain available but should not be used as primary references.
