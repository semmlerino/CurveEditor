# Import Organization Progress - 2025-05-28/29

**Note**: This document has been moved to the archive as the import organization task has been completed. For current project status and documentation, please refer to:
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `docs/refactoring-history.md` - Complete refactoring history
- `TODO.md` - Any remaining tasks

## Files with Fixed Imports

Successfully reorganized imports in the following files according to PEP 8 standards:

### Core Files
1. **main_window.py** ✅
   - Separated standard library, third-party, and local imports
   - Removed duplicate imports
   - Fixed duplicate logger initialization

2. **curve_view.py** ✅
   - Reorganized imports into proper sections
   - Consolidated typing imports

3. **ui_components.py** ✅
   - Fixed mixed import organization
   - Properly separated PySide6 imports from local imports

### UI Components
4. **menu_bar.py** ✅
   - Moved shebang line to top
   - Removed commented-out imports
   - Properly organized all imports

### Services
5. **services/file_service.py** ✅
   - Reorganized imports by category
   - Kept special module loading logic separate

6. **services/curve_service.py** ✅
   - Separated standard, third-party, and local imports
   - Maintained proper order for type checking imports

### Core Components
7. **signal_registry.py** ✅
   - Fixed malformed docstring placement
   - Consolidated all typing imports
   - Removed commented-out and duplicate imports

## Import Organization Standards Applied

All fixed files now follow this pattern:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""Docstring"""

# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from typing import Any, Dict, List

# Third-party imports
from PySide6.QtCore import Qt, Signal
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QWidget

# Local imports
from services.logging_service import LoggingService
from services.curve_service import CurveService

# Conditional imports
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from curve_view import CurveView
```

## Files Remaining

The following files still need import organization:
- [ ] All files in project (use fix_all_imports.py to process systematically)

## Tools Created

1. **analyze_imports.py** - Analyzes import organization issues
2. **fix_imports.py** - Fixes import organization for a single file
3. **fix_all_imports.py** - Batch processes multiple files

## Verification

After fixing imports, verify:
1. No circular imports
2. All imports resolve correctly
3. Application runs without import errors
4. Type checking passes

**Total Files Fixed**: 32+ files across three sessions (2025-05-28 and 2025-05-29)

**Archived Date**: 2025-05-29
**Final Status**: Import organization task completed
