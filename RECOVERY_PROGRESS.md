# Recovery Progress Report

## Completed Recovery Steps ✅

### 1. Safety Backup Created
- Stashed all Phase 4-6 changes to `recovery-backup` branch
- All changes preserved for potential future reference

### 2. Controller Structure Restored
- ✅ Removed consolidated controllers (data_controller.py, interaction_controller.py, view_controller.py)
- ✅ Restored 12 original controllers from deprecated folder
- ✅ Updated controllers/__init__.py to import original controllers
- ✅ Fixed test imports (removed tests for consolidated controllers)

### 3. Initial Testing Results

#### Type Checking Progress
- **Before recovery**: 1,701 errors
- **After controller restoration**: 1,518 errors
- **Improvement**: 183 errors fixed (11% reduction)

#### Test Execution
- ✅ Syntax check passes
- ✅ Core model tests: 134/134 passed
- Main application can import successfully

## What Was Reverted

### Phase 4 (Controller Consolidation) - REVERTED ✅
- Removed the 3 consolidated controllers
- Restored the 12 original controllers
- This was the main source of type errors

### Phase 5 (Validation Simplification) - PARTIALLY FIXED
- Already re-added missing validation functions during review
- Functions restored: validate_finite, validate_point, validate_file_path

### Phase 6 (MainWindow Merge) - KEPT ✅
- Kept modernized UI files deleted (correct decision)
- main_window.py remains as single implementation
- This was actually a good change

## Current Status

### Working
- Core models fully functional
- Basic imports work
- Controller structure restored
- UI simplified (good)

### Still Broken
- 1,518 type errors remaining
- Many test failures expected
- Potential segfault still present

## Next Priority Actions

1. **Fix remaining type errors** (1,518)
   - Most likely in service layer interactions
   - May need compatibility shims

2. **Test systematically**
   - Run test suite in small batches
   - Identify and isolate segfault
   - Fix failures incrementally

3. **Stabilize application**
   - Ensure file operations work
   - Verify UI responsiveness
   - Test critical workflows

## Recovery Assessment

The recovery is progressing well:
- 11% of type errors fixed just by reverting Phase 4
- Core functionality preserved
- Good changes (Phase 6) kept
- Bad changes (Phase 4) reverted

The application is in a much better state than before recovery started, though still needs significant work to be production-ready.

## Time Spent
- Phase 1-2 (Backup & Controller Recovery): ~30 minutes
- Current state: Partially recovered, continuing fixes
