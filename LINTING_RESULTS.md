## üìä Ruff Results

### Initial State
- **246 errors** found

### After Auto-fix
- **218 fixed** automatically (mostly whitespace issues)
- **27 remaining** that need manual intervention

  8  W291  trailing-whitespace             [FIXED]
  7  F401  unused-import                  [MANUAL]
  5  F541  f-string-missing-placeholders   [MANUAL]
  4  I001  unsorted-imports                [MANUAL]
  3  W292  missing-newline-at-end-of-file  [FIXED]
  1  E712  true-false-comparison           [MANUAL]
  1  F811  redefined-while-unused          [MANUAL]
  1  UP038 non-pep604-isinstance           [MANUAL]
  1  UP045 non-pep604-annotation-optional  [MANUAL]
```

### Files with Remaining Issues
- `final_verification.py` - 2 unused variables (t1, t2)
- `ui/curve_view_widget.py` - 4 unused variables (center_x, center_y, image_scale_x, image_scale_y)
- `tests/test_input_service.py` - 1 unused variable (main_window)
- `tests/test_integration_real.py` - 1 improper boolean comparison
- `verify_integration.py` - 1 unused variable (result)
- `services/data_service.py` - 1 isinstance modernization needed
- `services/interaction_service.py` - 1 Optional type annotation modernization

### Command to Check
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && ruff check .
```

### Command to Auto-fix Remaining Safe Issues
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes
```

## üîç Basedpyright Results

### Known State (from CLAUDE.md)
- **424 errors** (legitimate type issues)
- **5,129 warnings** (mostly PySide6 unknown types - expected without stubs)
- **0 notes**

### Current Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Basedpyright times out due to the large number of issues. This is a known problem documented in CLAUDE.md.

### Common Type Issues
1. PySide6 type stubs not installed (causes most warnings)
2. Missing type annotations on function parameters
3. Incompatible return types
4. Protocol mismatches

### Command to Check (using wrapper)
```bash
./bpr
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always use the `./bpr` wrapper script, not `basedpyright` directly, due to a shell redirection bug.

## üéØ Summary

### Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Fixed 218 formatting issues automatically
- ‚úÖ Reduced errors from 246 to 27
- ‚úÖ Code is now much cleaner and consistent

### Remaining Work
- 27 manual fixes needed (mostly unused variables)
- Type checking issues remain (expected with PySide6)

### Priority Fixes
1. **Unused variables** - Can be removed or used
2. **Unused imports** - Can be removed
3. **F-strings without placeholders** - Convert to regular strings
4. **Boolean comparison** - Use `not x` instead of `x == False`

### Recommendation
The code quality has improved significantly. The remaining issues are minor and don't affect functionality. Type checking issues are mostly due to missing PySide6 stubs, which is a known limitation.

## üöÄ Quick Fixes

To clean up the most critical issues:

```python
# Fix unused variables - either use them or prefix with _
_ = t1  # Mark as intentionally unused
# OR just remove the assignment

# Fix boolean comparison
# Before: assert window.isVisible() == False
# After: assert not window.isVisible()

# Fix f-string without placeholders
# Before: f"Some string"
# After: "Some string"
```
