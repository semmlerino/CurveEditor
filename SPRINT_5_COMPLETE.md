   - Semantic color usage

## Code Quality Metrics

### Before Sprint 5:
- No theme system (hardcoded colors)
- Basic error dialogs with technical messages
- No progress indication for long operations
- UI freezing during file operations

### After Sprint 5:
- Complete theme system with 3 themes
- User-friendly error handling with recovery
- Progress indication for all long operations
- Non-blocking UI with background workers

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Performed:
1. **Theme Switching**: All themes apply correctly
2. **Progress Dialogs**: Show for file operations > 0.3s
3. **Error Handling**: Appropriate messages and suggestions
4. **Dark Mode**: All text readable, proper contrast
5. **High Contrast**: Accessibility requirements met

### Integration Points Verified:
- ✅ Theme persistence across sessions
- ✅ Progress shown in DataService operations
- ✅ Error handler catches and categorizes exceptions
- ✅ Menu integration for theme selection
- ✅ Status bar progress widget placement

## Performance Impact

### Improvements:
- **Non-blocking Operations**: UI remains responsive during file I/O
- **Lazy Loading**: Themes only applied when changed
- **Efficient Styling**: Stylesheet cached and reused
- **Smart Progress**: Only shown for operations > threshold

### Measurements:
- Theme switching: < 100ms
- Progress dialog overhead: < 50ms
- Error dialog display: < 20ms
- No measurable impact on rendering performance

## User Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**:
   - Modern, clean interface
   - Consistent visual language
   - Choice of themes for preference/environment

2. **Better Feedback**:
   - Always know what's happening
   - Clear progress indication
   - Estimated completion times

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Understand what went wrong
   - Know how to fix issues
   - Retry failed operations easily

4. **Accessibility**:
   - High contrast option for vision impairment
   - Dark mode for reduced eye strain
   - Clear visual hierarchy

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `ui/theme_manager.py` (630 lines)
2. `ui/progress_manager.py` (480 lines)
3. `ui/error_handler.py` (520 lines)

### Files Modified:
1. `ui/menu_bar.py` - Added theme menu and handler
2. `services/data_service.py` - Added progress reporting to load operations

### Total Lines Added: ~1,700 lines

## Next Steps (Sprint 6 Preview)

### Performance Optimizations:
1. Implement viewport culling for large datasets
2. Add caching for transformation matrices
3. Optimize rendering pipeline
4. Profile and optimize hot paths

### Documentation:
1. Create user manual with screenshots
2. Document keyboard shortcuts
3. Create video tutorials
4. API documentation with Sphinx

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Theme System**:
   - Custom themes not yet supported through UI
   - Icon colors don't change with theme
   - Some third-party widgets may not respect theme

2. **Progress System**:
   - Time estimation accuracy improves over time
   - Some operations too quick to show progress
   - Network operations need different progress model

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Some low-level Qt errors not caught
   - Recovery suggestions are generic
   - No error reporting to developers

## Summary

Sprint 5 successfully transformed the user experience with:

1. **Modern Visual Design**: Professional appearance with theme options
