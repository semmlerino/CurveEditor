# Session Summary - October 6, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive Phase 6 migration plan review, verification, and test suite creation.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Agent Reviews (Concurrent Execution)
Launched 3 agents in parallel to review Phase 6 documentation:
- **python-expert-architect**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 stars, 88% confidence)
- **python-code-reviewer**: 72% confidence, found 9 bugs in setup phases
- **best-practices-checker**: 68/100, identified timeline and risk issues

### 2. Critical Path Reviews (5 Agents in Parallel)
- **Phase 6.0-6.2 (Setup)**: Architecture ⭐⭐⭐⭐, Code Review 72%, Best Practices assessment
- **Phase 6.3 (CurveDataStore Removal)**: Code Review 35%, Best Practices 72/100
- **Phase 6.4-6.7 (Cleanup)**: Best Practices 62/100

### 3. Systematic Verification
Verified all 10 major agent claims using grep, find_symbol, and code reads:
- ✅ 6 claims confirmed correct
- ❌ 3 claims refuted (overcounting issues)
- ⚠️ 1 claim partially verified

### 4. Documentation Updates (7 Files)

| File | Changes | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Main Plan** | Timeline: 2-3 days → 4-6 days<br>Success: 93% → 75-80%<br>File counts corrected | Realistic estimates |
| **Phase 6.1** | selected_indices: 40+ → 2 production calls | Accurate scope |
| **Phase 6.2** | Fixed property getter (showed wrong code) | Critical fix |
| **Phase 6.3** | Added timeline_tabs.py<br>Fixed StoreManager (fictional → real code)<br>Added 7 missing files | Complete coverage |
| **Phase 6.4** | Added batch_edit.py + protocols | Complete coverage |
| **Phase 6.0** | Fixed circular dependency in exit criteria | Unblocked |

### 5. Test Suite Creation ✅

Created `tests/test_phase6_validation.py`:
- **14 comprehensive tests** (6 required + 4 optional + 4 agent-recommended)
- **11 passing tests** (validate current implementation)
- **3 XFAIL tests** (document future requirements)
- **0 real failures** (all issues expected/documented)

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### BLOCKER #1: Phase 6.2 Property Getter Was Wrong
- **Issue**: Showed ApplicationState code (Phase 6.3+) instead of CurveDataStore
- **Impact**: Would break Phase 6.2 implementation
- **Fix**: Updated to use `_curve_store.get_data()` with migration note

### BLOCKER #2: Phase 6.0 Referenced Non-Existent Tests
- **Issue**: Exit criteria referenced Phase 6.2 validation tests before they exist
- **Impact**: Circular dependency prevented Phase 6.1 start
- **Fix**: Removed reference, added proper exit criteria

### BLOCKER #3: StoreManager ApplicationState Integration Was Fictional
- **Issue**: Plan showed code that doesn't exist in current codebase
- **Impact**: Phase 6.3 Step 5 instructions were incorrect
- **Fix**: Rewrote with actual current code + complete migration steps

### BLOCKER #4: timeline_tabs.py Completely Missing
- **Issue**: 10 CurveDataStore references, 6 signal connections not in plan
- **Impact**: Timeline would break after Phase 6.3
- **Fix**: Added Step 2.5 to Phase 6.3 with full migration

### BLOCKER #5: 7 Production Files Missing from Phase 6.3
- **Issue**: Only listed 6 critical files, actual count is 13
- **Impact**: Incomplete migration would leave orphaned code
- **Fix**: Added all 7 missing files with descriptions

### BLOCKER #6: Phase 6.2 Validation Tests Didn't Exist
- **Issue**: Plan referenced test suite that wasn't created
- **Impact**: Could not validate Phase 6.2 before Phase 6.3
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive 14-test suite (11 passing, 3 xfailed)

## Verification Summary

| Metric | Claimed | Verified | Result |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| **StoreManager ApplicationState** | Has integration | ❌ Doesn't exist | FICTIONAL |
| **timeline_tabs.py in plan** | Not mentioned | ❌ Should be | MISSING |
| **Files with CurveDataStore** | 8 files | ✅ 13 files | UNDERCOUNT |
| **Phase 6.2 tests exist** | Complete | ❌ Don't exist | BLOCKER |
| **curve_data setter** | Read-only | ❌ No setter yet | PRE-PHASE 6.2 |
| **Indexed assignments** | 7 locations | ✅ 7 locations | ACCURATE |
| **batch_edit.py in 6.4** | 4 files | ✅ 5 files | MISSING |
| **Test count (.curve_view)** | 16 files | ✅ 6 files | OVERCOUNT |
| **selected_indices calls** | 40+ | ❌ 2 production | GREP OVERCOUNT |
| **Timeline estimate** | 2-3 days | ⚠️ 4-6 days realistic | UNDERESTIMATE |

## Archived Files

### Outdated Audit
- **File**: `docs/phase6_plan_code_audit.md`
- **Moved to**: `docs/archive/phase6_audits_outdated/phase6_plan_code_audit_2025-10-06_OUTDATED.md`
- **Reason**: Grep pattern `\.selected_indices\s*=` matched assertions, leading to 40+ overcount

---

## Test Suite Details

### Required Tests (6)
1. ⚠️ test_curve_data_property_is_read_only - XFAIL (pending Phase 6.2)
2. ⚠️ test_selected_indices_property_is_read_only - XFAIL (pending Phase 6.2)
3. ✅ test_curve_data_thread_safety_during_batch - PASS (validates thread enforcement)
4. ✅ test_rendering_all_visible_no_active_curve - PASS (multi-curve edge case)
5. ⚠️ test_frame_store_syncs_on_active_curve_switch - XFAIL (documents known bug)
6. ✅ test_active_curve_none_rendering - PASS (null safety)

### Optional Integration Tests (4)
7. ✅ test_batch_signal_deduplication - PASS
8. ✅ test_selection_bidirectional_sync - PASS
9. ✅ test_undo_redo_integration_post_migration - PASS
10. ✅ test_session_save_restore_post_migration - PASS

### Agent-Recommended Tests (4)
11. ✅ test_indexed_assignment_still_works_pre_phase63 - PASS
12. ✅ test_batch_operation_exception_handling - PASS
13. ✅ test_signal_migration_completeness - PASS
14. ✅ test_memory_leak_prevention - PASS

**Result**: 11 passed, 3 xfailed (expected)

## Updated Metrics

### Timeline
- **Before**: 2-3 days
- **After**: 4-6 days (realistic for 25 prod files + validation)

### Success Probability
- **Before**: 93% (VERY HIGH)
- **After**: 75-80% (realistic for major breaking change)

### File Counts
- **Production files (Phase 6.3)**: 8 → **15 files**
- **selected_indices calls**: 40+ → **2 production calls**
- **curve_view files**: 4 → **5 files**
- **Total production files**: ~10 → **25 files**

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Grep Pattern Issues
- Pattern `\.selected_indices\s*=` matches BOTH setter calls AND assertions
- Led to 40+ count when actual production calls = 2
- **Lesson**: Always verify grep results with code inspection

### 2. ApplicationState Thread Safety
- Enforces main thread access (prevents race conditions by design)
- Initial test expected concurrent access - this was wrong assumption
- **Lesson**: Qt thread safety is built-in, not a bug

### 3. StoreManager Has No ApplicationState Integration
- Plan showed "Current (Phase 5)" code that doesn't exist
- Actual code only uses CurveDataStore
- **Lesson**: Verify all "current state" code examples against codebase

### 4. Phase 6.2 Tests Are Required BEFORE Phase 6.3
- Can't validate read-only enforcement without test suite
- Can't proceed to Phase 6.3 without validating Phase 6.2
- **Lesson**: Validation tests are prerequisites, not optional

### Optional (Recommended)
7. ⬜ **Add smoke tests for user workflows** - Drag-drop, undo/redo, save/load
8. ⬜ **Add performance benchmarks** - Baseline before Phase 6.3
9. ⬜ **Create rollback test script** - Verify rollback works
