# Next Phase Decision Matrix

## Quick Decision Guide

### What Should I Do Next?

#### If you want STABILITY:
→ **Start with Phase 2**: Fix remaining test failures
- Impact: High (improves reliability)
- Effort: Medium (2-3 days)
- Risk: Low (well-defined scope)

#### If you want SIMPLICITY:
→ **Start with Phase 3**: Remove dual architecture
- Impact: High (reduces complexity)
- Effort: Medium (2 days)
- Risk: Medium (need careful testing)

#### If you want PERFORMANCE:
→ **Start with Phase 4**: Optimize and benchmark
- Impact: Medium (already reasonably fast)
- Effort: High (3-4 days)
- Risk: Low (non-breaking changes)

#### If you want DEPLOYMENT:
→ **Start with Phase 5**: Production polish
- Impact: High (enables real usage)
- Effort: High (4-5 days)
- Risk: Low (additive changes)

## Recommended Path
1. **Commit current work** (30 min) ✓ Preserve progress
2. **Fix test failures** (2 days) ✓ Achieve 95% pass rate
3. **Remove dual architecture** (2 days) ✓ Simplify codebase
4. **Production polish** (3 days) ✓ Make deployment-ready
5. **Performance optimization** (ongoing) ✓ Enhance as needed

## Current Blockers
- ❌ None - Ready to proceed with any phase

## Quick Wins Available
1. Commit documentation reorganization (30 min)
2. Skip/fix performance benchmarks (1 hour)
3. Delete backup files (5 min)
4. Update README with current status (15 min)

## Not Recommended Now
- ❌ Adding new features (stabilize first)
- ❌ Major refactoring (already consolidated)
- ❌ UI redesign (current UI is functional)
