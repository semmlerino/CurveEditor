# Phase 1.5 Test Infrastructure - Quick Summary

**Status**: ❌ **BLOCKED** - Critical fixture bugs prevent test execution
**Grade**: C+ (Good structure, major implementation issues)
**Ready for Phase 2**: NO - Must fix and complete tests first
**Estimated Work**: 12-18 hours (1.5-2 days)

---

## Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

1. **Wrong fixture names**: Tests use `main_window_mock` but fixture is `mock_main_window`
2. **Missing StateManager mock**: No fixture for `StateManagerProtocol`
3. **83% incomplete**: Only 4 of 24 tests implemented

**Result**: 0% of tests run, all fail at setup

---

## What Was Created

- ✅ 8 test files (one per controller)
- ✅ 24 test stubs (3-5 per controller)
- ✅ Good test structure (AAA pattern, descriptive names)
- ✅ Right methods identified (critical paths)
- ❌ 3 tests partially implemented
- ❌ 21 tests are stubs (`pass`)
- ❌ Fixtures completely broken

---

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix fixture names** (1 hour) - Change `main_window_mock` → `mock_main_window`
2. **Create `mock_state_manager` fixture** (2 hours) - Implement `StateManagerProtocol`
3. **Create controller fixtures** (2 hours) - In `tests/fixtures/controller_fixtures.py`
4. **Implement 20 stub tests** (8-12 hours) - Complete all `pass` stubs
5. **Verify tests pass** (2 hours) - Debug, validate, ensure coverage

**Total: 15-19 hours**

## Test Distribution

| Controller | Tests | Implemented | Stubs |
|------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| ActionHandlerController | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| FrameChangeCoordinator | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| PointEditorController | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| SignalConnectionManager | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| TimelineController | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| UIInitializationController | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| ViewCameraController | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| ViewManagementController | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **24** | **4 (17%)** | **20 (83%)** |

## Key Recommendations

### Critical Priority (Fix Now)
- Fix fixture naming in all 8 test files
- Create `mock_state_manager` fixture
- Use `protocol_compliant_mock_main_window`

### High Priority (Before Phase 2)
- Complete all 20 stub implementations
- Add signal verification (QSignalSpy)
- Verify 70%+ controller coverage

### Design Philosophy
- **Prefer protocol-compliant mocks** over MagicMock
- **Mix unit and integration tests** (70% unit, 30% integration)
- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **Follow project philosophy**: "Prefer real components over mocks"

---

## Why This Matters for Phase 2

Phase 2 refactoring depends on tests to:
- ✅ Validate behavior preservation
- ✅ Detect regressions
- ✅ Enable confident refactoring

**Without working tests**: Phase 2 cannot proceed safely.
