## Quote of the Day

> "The perfect sprint is the enemy of the good sprint. We delivered good."

## Handoff Message

To the next developer/sprint lead:

Sprint 9 is complete. We didn't achieve the original 80% coverage goal, but we:
- Fixed a critical testing gap
- Built essential infrastructure
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Established a path forward

The codebase is safer than when we started. The foundation exists for continued improvement. Focus on incremental progress in Sprint 10.

All necessary documentation is in place. Start with the handoff checklist.

Good luck! ðŸš€
