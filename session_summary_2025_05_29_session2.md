# CurveEditor Refactoring Session Summary
## Date: 2025-05-29 (Fourth Session)

### Starting State:
- UI component extraction: Complete (6 specialized modules)
- Service layer rationalization: Complete
- Import organization: Nearly complete (32 files done)
- Previous commit hash: f47d6ae
- Current commit hash: 531aa60

### Planned Work:
1. Complete import organization for remaining service files
2. Check and fix imports in protocol files
3. Validate circular import issues
4. Run type checking if time permits
5. Update documentation as needed

### Files To Check:
- services/enhanced_curve_view_integration.py
- services/unified_transform.py
- services/unified_transformation_service.py
- services/transformation_integration.py
- services/models.py
- services/protocols.py (already done in session 3)
- batch_edit_protocols.py

### Work Log:

#### Import Organization Check:
1. **Files Checked (all already properly organized):**
   - services/enhanced_curve_view_integration.py ✓
   - services/unified_transform.py ✓
   - services/unified_transformation_service.py ✓
   - services/transformation_integration.py ✓
   - services/models.py ✓
   - batch_edit_protocols.py ✓

2. **Import Organization Status:**
   - All service files already follow PEP 8 import standards
   - Order is correct: standard library → third-party → local
   - No empty or malformed imports found
   - No import reorganization needed

3. **Next Actions:**
   - Since all imports are already properly organized, moving to next phase
   - Will check for circular import issues

#### Circular Import Check:
1. **Analysis Performed:**
   - Checked for imports of main_window from service files: None found ✓
   - Checked for imports of main_window from UI component files: None found ✓
   - Examined import structure in main modules: Clean separation maintained ✓

2. **Results:**
   - No circular imports detected
   - Service layer maintains proper separation from UI layer
   - Component files are independent and don't import from main_window

3. **Current Refactoring Status:**
   - Import organization: Complete ✓
   - Circular import check: Complete ✓
   - All service files are properly isolated
   - Architecture maintains clean separation of concerns

#### Signal Registry Refactoring:
1. **File Identified for Refactoring:**
   - signal_registry.py (781 lines) - too large for a single module
   - Contains all signal connections in one place
   - Could be split into smaller, focused modules

2. **Refactoring Plan:**
   - Split into multiple signal connector modules by functional area:
     - file_signal_connector.py (file operations signals)
     - view_signal_connector.py (curve view related signals)
     - edit_signal_connector.py (editing operations signals)
     - ui_signal_connector.py (UI component signals)
     - shortcut_signal_connector.py (keyboard shortcuts)
   - Keep signal_registry.py as a facade that imports and orchestrates
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Starting Implementation:**
   - Creating modular signal connectors
   - Each module will handle signals for its specific domain

4. **Progress:**
   - ✅ Created signal_connectors package directory
   - ✅ Created file_signal_connector.py (handles file operations)
   - ✅ Created view_signal_connector.py (handles curve view signals)
   - ✅ Created visualization_signal_connector.py (handles visualization controls)
   - TODO: Create remaining connectors (edit, ui, shortcuts)
   - TODO: Refactor signal_registry.py to use new modules
