## Analysis Highlights

### Strongest Areas
✓ Service-based architecture with clear concerns  
✓ Single source of truth (ApplicationState)  
✓ Command pattern for undo/redo (well-implemented)  
✓ Focused state protocols (`FrameProvider`, `CurveDataProvider`, etc.)  
✓ Modern Python 3.10+ syntax adoption  
✓ Thread-safe design with `_assert_main_thread()`  
✓ Good use of Qt signals for cross-component communication  

### Weakest Areas
✗ 3 God Objects (ApplicationState, InteractionService, MainWindow)  
✗ SRP violations: classes with 7+ responsibilities, 1000+ LOC  
✗ ISP violations: Services expose 30+ methods, clients need 4-5  
✗ DIP violations: Services directly import/instantiate other services  
✗ Type safety gaps: Local variables missing hints in hot paths  
✗ Protocol underutilization: Service layer lacks focused protocols  

## Key Findings

### Finding #1: ApplicationState God Object (Impact 9/10)
**Location:** `/stores/application_state.py:71-1106` (1,160 LOC)

Manages 7 unrelated domains:
1. Curve data storage
2. Point selection per curve
3. Active curve tracking
4. Frame navigation
5. Image sequence management
6. Curve visibility & metadata
7. Original data for restoration
8. Batch update coordination

**Issue:** Multiple reasons to change = SRP violation  
**Solution:** Extract CurveDataManager, SelectionManager, FrameNavigator, ImageSequenceManager  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours | **Risk:** High

### Finding #2: InteractionService Complexity (Impact 8/10)
**Location:** `/services/interaction_service.py:54-1460` (1,761 LOC)

Contains 4 internal classes mixing concerns:
- `_MouseHandler` (300+ lines): Event parsing + drag + pan + rubber band selection
- `_SelectionManager` (200+ lines): Selection logic + spatial indexing
- `_CommandHistory` (150+ lines): Undo/redo management
- `_PointManipulator` (200+ lines): Point operations

**Issue:** Cannot test drag logic independently from mouse events  
**Solution:** Separate MouseEventParser, DragHandler, SelectionHandler  
**Effort:** 5-7 hours | **Risk:** High

### Finding #3: MainWindow God Object (Impact 8/10)
**Location:** `/ui/main_window.py:97-1315` (1,315 LOC)

Manages 8 unrelated concerns:
1. UI layout (menu bar, toolbars, dock widgets, status bar)
2. Widget management (50+ widget references)
3. Controller coordination (8+ controllers)
4. Event handling (keyboard, close, resize)
5. File operations (open/save dialogs)
6. State management (signal connections)
7. View management (zoom, pan, fit)
8. Command execution (menu/keyboard handlers)

**Issue:** Cannot test menu creation without full MainWindow  
**Solution:** Extract MenuBarFactory, DockWidgetFactory, ControllerFactory  
**Effort:** 6-8 hours | **Risk:** High

### Finding #4: Quick Wins Available (3.75 hours, +20 score)
1. Add @Slot decorators (0.5h, ~20 handlers)
2. Add local type hints (1.5h, mouse handlers)
3. Extract FileLoaderProtocol (1h, from DataService)
4. Extract MenuBarFactory (0.75h, from MainWindow)

## Refactoring Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [x] Quick Wins: 3.75 hours, +20 score
  - Add @Slot decorators to signal handlers
  - Add local variable type hints
  - Extract FileLoaderProtocol
  - Extract MenuBarFactory

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)
- Refactor ApplicationState (4-6h)
- Extract service protocols (3-4h)
- Improve error handling (3-4h)
- **Impact:** +25 score

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
- Refactor MainWindow (6-8h)
- Reorganize InteractionService (5-7h)
- Add comprehensive tests (5-6h)
- **Impact:** +30 score

**Total Effort for Full Remediation:** 25-35 hours  
**Total Expected Improvement:** +70 points (62→85-90/100)

## Type Safety Status

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Type Hint Coverage | 85% | 98% |
| Union Syntax (X \| None) | 95% modern | 100% modern |
| Local Variables Annotated | 40% | 100% (hot paths) |
| @Slot Coverage | 60% | 100% |

**Effort:** 1-2 hours | **Impact:** +5 score

## Protocol Adoption Status

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✓ `FrameProvider` - Current frame access
- ✓ `CurveDataProvider` - Read-only curve data
- ✓ `CurveDataModifier` - Write curve data
- ✓ `SelectionProvider` - Read-only selection
- ✓ `SelectionModifier` - Write selection
- ✓ `ImageSequenceProvider` - Image info

**Should Extract:**
- `FileLoaderProtocol` - CSV/JSON/2DTrack loading (from DataService)
- `CurveAnalyzerProtocol` - Smoothing/filtering/outlier detection (from DataService)
- `TransformServiceProtocol` - Coordinate transformations (already implicit)
- `PointManipulationProtocol` - Point-level operations (from InteractionService)

**Effort:** 3-4 hours | **Impact:** +6 score

## How to Use This Analysis

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Are these violations critical?**  
A: The 3 God Objects are high-impact but localized. The codebase has strong fundamentals that make refactoring feasible.

**Q: Should I refactor all at once?**  
A: No. Start with quick wins (3.75h), then tackle highest-impact issues. Full refactoring: 25-35 hours over 2-3 months.

**Q: Will refactoring break existing code?**  
A: Low risk with careful approach. Use ApplicationState facade pattern for backward compatibility. Command pattern already designed for this.

**Q: What's the highest priority?**  
A: ApplicationState refactoring (impact 9/10). It touches 20+ components. Start by adding focused protocols, then split concerns.

**Q: Can I fix quick wins now?**  
A: Yes! They're independent: @Slot decorators, type hints, FileLoaderProtocol, MenuBarFactory. Total: 3.75 hours, no risk.

## Next Steps
