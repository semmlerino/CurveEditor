# PLAN TAU: AMENDMENTS APPLIED ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All amendments applied to plan documents

---

## SUMMARY OF CHANGES

All amendments from the second-pass verification have been successfully applied to Plan TAU documents.

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #1: Phase 2.1 Frame Clamping Count

**File:** `plan_tau/phase2_quick_wins.md`
**Lines:** 11-25, 278-281
**Status:** ✅ APPLIED

**Changes:**
- Updated impact from "60 duplications" to "5 frame clamps + 30+ other patterns"
- Added scope clarification with pattern distribution
- Updated success metrics to reflect actual counts

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "frame = max.*min.*frame" ui/ stores/ --include="*.py" | wc -l
5  # Confirmed: Exactly 5 frame-specific clamps
```

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #2: Phase 3.2 Circular Import Fix

**File:** `plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md`
**Lines:** 621-632, 645-648, 1217-1221
**Status:** ✅ APPLIED

**Changes:**
- Added `selection_service` parameter to MouseInteractionService.__init__
- Changed `get_interaction_service()` call to `self._selection_service`
- Updated InteractionService to inject dependency properly

**Before:**
```python
from services import get_interaction_service  # ❌ Circular import
result = get_interaction_service().find_point_at(...)
```

**After:**
```python
result = self._selection_service.find_point_at(...)  # ✅ Injected dependency
```

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #3: Service Lifetime Clarification

**File:** `plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md`
**Lines:** 1226-1271
**Status:** ✅ APPLIED

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive "Service Lifetime Pattern" section
- Explained why no QObject parent is needed
- Showed existing service pattern from codebase
- Listed 5 reasons why parent is not required

**Key Points:**
1. Services are NOT QWidgets (no visual representation)
2. Services are singletons (created once, never destroyed)
3. Matches existing DataService, TransformService, UIService pattern
4. Services live for application lifetime
5. Qt parent/child is for widget hierarchy, not service containers

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #4: Documentation-Code Mismatch Fix

**File:** `TIMELINE_DESYNC_CORRECTION.md` (NEW)
**Status:** ✅ CREATED

**Changes:**
- Created comprehensive correction document
- Explains what actually fixed the desync (synchronous visual updates)
- Provides evidence (grep results showing NO Qt.QueuedConnection)
- Lists affected files needing comment updates
- References correct documentation (TIMELINE_DESYNC_FIX_SUMMARY.md)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Create correction document ✅
- [ ] Update TIMELINE_DESYNC_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md (future)
- [ ] Fix comments in ui/state_manager.py (future)
- [ ] Fix comments in ui/controllers/frame_change_coordinator.py (future)

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #5: Executive Summary Metrics

**File:** `plan_tau/00_executive_summary.md`
**Lines:** 11-20
**Status:** ✅ APPLIED

**Changes:**
- Replaced vague "~1,258 duplications" with specific breakdown
- Listed each type of duplication with verified counts
- Total reduction: ~1,000 lines (verified against codebase)

**New Breakdown:**
- 5 frame clamps → utility
- 18 RuntimeError handlers → @safe_slot
- 350+ StateManager delegations → ApplicationState
- 58 transform getters → helpers
- 33 active curve patterns → helpers

---

## ✅ AMENDMENT #6: Service Pattern Verification

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (No changes needed)

**Finding:** Phase 3.2 service creation pattern **already matches** existing codebase pattern.

**Evidence from `services/__init__.py:96-105`:**
```python
def get_data_service() -> "DataService":
    global _data_service
    with _service_lock:
        if _data_service is None:
            _data_service = DataService()  # ← No parent
    return _data_service
```

**Conclusion:** First review incorrectly flagged this. Pattern is CORRECT.

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Run these commands to verify all amendments were applied correctly:

```bash
# 1. Verify Phase 2.1 count updated
grep -n "Eliminates 5 frame clamp duplications" plan_tau/phase2_quick_wins.md
# Expected: Line 11

# 2. Verify circular import fixed
grep -n "from services import get_interaction_service" plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md | grep -A2 "handle_mouse_press"
# Expected: NO matches in handle_mouse_press method

# 3. Verify service lifetime documented
grep -n "Service Lifetime Pattern" plan_tau/phase3_architectural_refactoring.md
# Expected: Line 1226

# 4. Verify correction document exists
test -f TIMELINE_DESYNC_CORRECTION.md && echo "✅ EXISTS" || echo "❌ MISSING"
# Expected: ✅ EXISTS

# 5. Verify executive summary updated
grep -n "Total reduction: ~1,000 lines" plan_tau/00_executive_summary.md
# Expected: Line 19

# 6. Verify actual baseline counts
echo "Frame clamps: $(grep -rn 'frame = max.*min.*frame' ui/ stores/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
echo "RuntimeError: $(grep -rn 'except RuntimeError' ui/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
echo "hasattr: $(grep -r 'hasattr(' ui/ services/ core/ --include='*.py' | wc -l)"
# Expected: 5, 18, 43
```
