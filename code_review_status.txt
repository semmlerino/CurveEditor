CURVE EDITOR CODE REVIEW STATUS
================================
Date: 2025-06-01
Focus: Logging issues and code cleanup

INITIAL FINDINGS:
- Logging verification shows loggers are created but log file is not being written
- All modules import successfully
- Need to investigate logging configuration

INVESTIGATION PROGRESS:
- Found logging configuration in services/logging_service.py
- Main application uses fixed log file: ~/.curve_editor/logs/curve_editor.log
- Verification scripts use timestamped log files
- Need to check if the main log file exists and is being written to

ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
- Child loggers created by get_logger() had propagate implicitly set to True
- But there was no explicit setting, which could cause issues
- File handler exceptions were being caught but not properly reported
- No flush() call after initial log message

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Added explicit child_logger.propagate = True in get_logger()
2. Added file_handler.flush() after initial log message
3. Enhanced error reporting for file handler creation failures
4. Added flush() calls in close() method before closing handlers

STATUS: Testing the fixes...
