CURVE EDITOR CODE REVIEW STATUS
================================
Started: 2025-01-06
Focus: Logging issues and code cleanup

REVIEW PROGRESS:

[2025-01-06 - START] Beginning code review
- Investigating logging configuration issues
- Log file not being created despite logger calls working

[2025-01-06 - INVESTIGATION] Analyzing logging configuration
- Found LoggingService in services/logging_service.py
- LoggingService uses 'curve_editor' namespace for logger, not root logger
- Main.py properly initializes logging with LoggingService.setup_logging()
- Logging configuration loads from ~/.curve_editor/logging_config.json
- Need to test if the logging actually writes to files

[2025-01-06 - DIAGNOSIS] Root cause analysis
- LoggingService creates FileHandler correctly in setup_logging()
- File handler is added to logger with proper formatter
- Handler.flush() is called to force write
- Logger is non-root ('curve_editor') with propagate=False
- Child loggers are created with propagate=True
- Possible issue: File handler might not be getting messages due to logger hierarchy

[2025-01-06 - SOLUTION] Fixing logging issue
- The problem is likely in the LoggingService.setup_logging() method
- Need to ensure file handler is properly attached and working
- Will add debug output and force file creation
