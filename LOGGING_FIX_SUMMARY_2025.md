# Logging Fix Summary - CurveEditor

## Date: June 2025

## Issue
The CurveEditor application had logging issues where log messages were not being written to the log file despite proper initialization.

## Root Cause
Multiple files were using `logging.getLogger(__name__)` directly instead of the centralized `LoggingService.get_logger()` method. This caused loggers to be created in the wrong namespace and not inherit the proper handlers configured by LoggingService.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed All Direct Logger Calls
Replaced all instances of:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

With:
```python
from services.logging_service import LoggingService
logger = LoggingService.get_logger("module_name")
```

### 2. Files Fixed
- signal_connectors/shortcut_signal_connector.py
- ui_components.py
- timeline_components.py
- csv_export.py
- signal_registry.py
- signal_connectors/view_signal_connector.py
- signal_connectors/edit_signal_connector.py
- application_state.py
- enhanced_curve_view.py

### 3. Logging Infrastructure
- LoggingService properly configured in `services/logging_service.py`
- Uses 'curve_editor' namespace for all loggers
- Supports both file and console output
- Main.py correctly initializes logging at startup
- Log files written to: `~/.curve_editor/logs/curve_editor.log`

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated `docs/transformation-system.md` to show correct logging usage

### 5. Cleanup
- Removed redundant fix scripts:
  - fix_all_logging.py
  - fix_logging_calls.py

### 6. Testing
- Created `verify_logging_fixes.py` to test logging functionality
- Verifies all modules can import correctly
- Tests that log messages are written to file

## Verification Steps
1. Run: `python verify_logging_fixes.py`
2. Check log file exists at: `~/.curve_editor/logs/curve_editor.log`
3. Run the main application and verify logs are being written

## Best Practices Going Forward
1. Always use `LoggingService.get_logger("module_name")` for new modules
2. Never use `logging.getLogger()` directly
3. Use descriptive module names for better log filtering
4. Configure log levels through `logging_config.json`

## Configuration
Log levels can be configured in: `~/.curve_editor/logging_config.json`
```json
{
  "global": "INFO",
  "curve_view": "INFO",
  "services": {
    "file_service": "INFO",
    "curve_service": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```
