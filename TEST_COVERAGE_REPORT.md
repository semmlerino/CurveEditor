## Test Failure Analysis

### Major Failure Categories:

#### 1. History Service Tests (20 failures)
All history service tests are failing because the new `HistoryService` from Sprint 8 is not integrated with the test suite.

#### 2. Service Integration Tests (15 failures)
Cross-service communication tests fail due to Sprint 8 refactoring.

#### 3. Data Pipeline Tests (10 failures)
File loading and data processing pipelines broken after service extraction.

#### 4. Performance Tests (9 failures)
Performance benchmarks need updating for new service architecture.

## Coverage Gaps by Priority

### üî¥ Priority 1: Sprint 8 Services (0% coverage)
**Impact**: High - Core functionality completely untested
**Effort**: Medium - Need new test files
**Files**:
- services/point_manipulation.py
- services/selection_service.py
- services/history_service.py
- services/compressed_snapshot.py

### üü† Priority 2: File Operations (13-16% coverage)
**Impact**: High - Data loading/saving critical
**Effort**: Low - Existing tests need fixing
**Files**:
- services/file_io_service.py
- services/image_sequence_service.py

### üü° Priority 3: UI Services (24% coverage)
**Impact**: Medium - UI operations
**Effort**: Medium - Mock heavy
**Files**:
- services/ui_service.py
- rendering/curve_renderer.py

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Day 5)
1. **Fix existing test suite** (2-3 hours)
   - Update imports for Sprint 8 services
   - Fix mock objects for new architecture
   - Resolve the 73 failing tests

2. **Write Sprint 8 service tests** (3-4 hours)
   - Test point_manipulation.py
   - Test selection_service.py
   - Test history_service.py
   - Test compressed_snapshot.py

### Day 6
1. **Integration tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Test service adapter pattern
   - Test feature flag switching
   - Test cross-service workflows

2. **File I/O tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Test JSON/CSV operations
   - Test image sequence loading
   - Test error handling

## Test Execution Command
```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
source venv/bin/activate
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Quick smoke test (working tests only)
python -m pytest tests/test_transform_service.py tests/test_view_state.py \
    tests/test_path_security.py --cov=services --cov-report=term
```

## Coverage Metrics Target

### Current State
- Overall: 32%
- Services: 21%
- UI: 51%
- Core: 65%

### Sprint 9 Target (80% for critical paths)
To reach 80% coverage on critical paths, we need:
1. Fix 73 failing tests (+15% coverage estimated)
2. Add Sprint 8 service tests (+20% coverage estimated)
3. Fix file I/O tests (+10% coverage estimated)
4. **Total estimated**: 32% + 45% = **77% coverage**

## Conclusion

The test suite is in poor condition primarily due to Sprint 8's service extraction not being accompanied by test updates. The good news is that most issues are mechanical (imports, mocks) rather than fundamental. With 2 days of focused effort, we can reach ~75-80% coverage on critical paths.

**Biggest Risk**: Sprint 8 services are completely untested and in production.
**Biggest Opportunity**: Fixing the 73 failing tests will immediately improve coverage.
