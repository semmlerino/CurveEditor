## How to Use

### 1. **Start Here:**
Open [README.md](README.md) - it has links to everything

### 2. **🤖 Use Specialized Agents (RECOMMENDED):**
- [**Agents Guide**](AGENTS.md) - Complete agent specifications
- [**Agent Quick Reference**](AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - Commands and workflow

**Each phase has TWO agents:**
1. **Implementation Agent** - Does the work
2. **Review Agent** - Verifies completion

### 3. **Implement Phase by Phase:**
- [Phase 1: Critical Safety Fixes](phase1_critical_safety_fixes.md) - **START HERE**
- [Phase 2: Quick Wins](phase2_quick_wins.md)
- [Phase 3: Architectural Refactoring](phase3_architectural_refactoring.md)
- [Phase 4: Polish & Optimization](phase4_polish_optimization.md)

### 4. **Reference as Needed:**
- [Verification & Testing](verification_and_testing.md) - Run after each task
- [Risk & Rollback](risk_and_rollback.md) - If things go wrong
- [Implementation Guide](implementation_guide.md) - Timeline and commit templates

## File Sizes

| File | Size | Lines | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| **Implementation Plans** |
| phase1_critical_safety_fixes.md | 24K | 845 | Week 1 implementation |
| phase2_quick_wins.md | 25K | 906 | Week 2 implementation |
| phase3_architectural_refactoring.md | 20K | 643 | Weeks 3-4 implementation |
| phase4_polish_optimization.md | 14K | 501 | Weeks 5-6 implementation |
| **🤖 Agent Specifications** |
| AGENTS.md | 20K | ~700 | Complete agent specs |
| AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md | 5.3K | ~200 | Quick reference card |
| **Support Documentation** |
| verification_and_testing.md | 1.9K | 94 | Testing procedures |
| risk_and_rollback.md | 3.5K | 131 | Safety procedures |
| implementation_guide.md | 4.3K | 148 | Timeline & templates |

**Total: ~4,290 lines** (vs. 3,268 in original - agents + navigation added)

## Navigation

Each file has navigation links at the bottom:
- **←** Previous phase
- **→** Next phase
- **↑** Back to overview

## Benefits of New Structure

✅ **Focused Reading** - Read only the phase you're working on
✅ **Easy Navigation** - Quick links between related sections
✅ **Better Organization** - Logical grouping by purpose
✅ **Version Control** - Smaller diffs, easier to track changes
✅ **Parallel Work** - Multiple people can work on different phases
✅ **🤖 Specialized Agents** - Dedicated implementation & review agents for quality assurance

## Recommended Workflow

```bash
# For each phase (example: Phase 1):

# Step 1: Implement using agent
claude-code --agent plan-tau-phase1-implementer \
  "Implement Task 1.1 from plan_tau/phase1_critical_safety_fixes.md"

# Step 2: Review using agent
claude-code --agent plan-tau-phase1-reviewer \
  "Review Phase 1 and create report"

# Step 3: Fix any issues found
# (Re-run implementation agent if needed)

# Step 4: Proceed to Phase 2 when review passes
```

See [AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for complete commands.

## Original File

The original `PLAN_TAU_DO_NOT_DELETE.md` has been preserved as `ORIGINAL_PLAN_TAU.md` in this folder for reference.
