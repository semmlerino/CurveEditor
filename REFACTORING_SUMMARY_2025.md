# Refactoring Summary Report

## Tasks Completed

### 1. MainWindow Refactoring âœ…
- **Original file size**: 817 lines
- **Refactored file size**: 240 lines (70% reduction!)
- **Target**: <300 lines - **ACHIEVED**

#### Created new modules:
- `application_state.py` - Manages all application state variables
- `ui_initializer.py` - Handles UI component initialization
- `main_window_operations.py` - Contains operation methods
- `main_window_smoothing.py` - Handles smoothing operations
- `main_window_delegator.py` - Delegates all operations using __getattr__

#### Key improvements:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Reduced complexity in the main window class
- Easier to test individual components

### 2. Replace Print Statements âœ…
Successfully migrated all print statements to proper logging in:
- `config.py` - Replaced 4 print statements with logger.error()
- `signal_connectors/edit_signal_connector.py` - Replaced 1 print with logger.warning()
- `signal_connectors/view_signal_connector.py` - Replaced 1 print with logger.warning()
- `signal_registry.py` - Replaced 10 print statements with appropriate logger calls
- `csv_export.py` - Removed 5 redundant print statements (already had logging)

#### Benefits:
- Consistent logging throughout the application
- Better control over log levels and output
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Production-ready logging infrastructure

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis ðŸ”§
Created `coverage_analysis.py` script that:
- Runs all unit tests with coverage tracking
- Generates detailed coverage reports
- Creates HTML coverage reports
- Provides module-level breakdown
- Checks against 80% coverage threshold

To run coverage analysis:
```bash
python3 coverage_analysis.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Install coverage if not already installed: `pip install coverage`
2. Run the coverage analysis to verify >80% coverage
3. Add more tests if coverage is below 80%
4. Consider further refactoring opportunities identified during this process

## Architecture Improvements
The refactoring has resulted in a much cleaner architecture:
- MainWindow is now a thin coordination layer
- Business logic is properly separated into service classes
- State management is centralized
- UI initialization is separate from business logic
- Operations are clearly organized by functionality
