# Zoom Floating Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Curves were floating/drifting when zooming with the mouse wheel instead of zooming smoothly around the cursor position.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Transform Inconsistency**: The wheelEvent was using different transforms for screen-to-data and data-to-screen conversions
2. **Double Cache Invalidation**: Transforms were being recreated multiple times during a single zoom operation
3. **Qt Event Timing**: Widget dimensions could be stale if Qt had pending geometry updates
4. **Numerical Precision**: Floating-point errors accumulated through the transformation pipeline

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Refactored wheelEvent Handler (`ui/curve_view_widget.py`)

**Before:**
- Converted screen to data with old transform
- Changed zoom factor
- Invalidated caches (new transform created)
- Converted data back to screen with new transform
- Double cache invalidation

**After:**
- Calculate zoom parameters upfront
- Convert screen to data BEFORE changing zoom
- Apply zoom change
- Calculate pan adjustment in one step
- Single cache invalidation after all changes
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Qt Event Processing (`ui/curve_view_widget.py:_update_transform`)

Added event processing to ensure widget geometry is current:
```python
QCoreApplication.processEvents(QEventLoop.ProcessEventsFlag.ExcludeUserInputEvents)
```

This ensures `self.width()` and `self.height()` return accurate values by processing pending geometry events.

### 3. Transform Scale Consistency (Already Fixed)

The TransformService was already correctly using the actual scale for center offset calculations, maintaining consistency between scaling and centering operations.

## Test Results

Created automated test (`test_zoom_fix.py`) to verify zoom stability:

**Before fixes:**
- Single zoom drift: 75.8px X, 42.6px Y
- Cumulative drift (10 zooms): 581.0px X, 326.8px Y

**After fixes:**
- Single zoom drift: **0.000px**
- Cumulative drift (10 zooms): **0.000px**

✅ **Complete elimination of zoom drift**

## Key Improvements

1. **Numerical Stability**: Maintaining transform consistency eliminates accumulation of floating-point errors
2. **Performance**: Single cache invalidation reduces transform recreation overhead
3. **Predictability**: Zoom now behaves exactly as expected - points under cursor stay fixed
4. **Qt Best Practices**: Processing pending events ensures accurate widget dimensions

## Files Modified

1. `/mnt/c/CustomScripts/Python/Work/Linux/CurveEditor/ui/curve_view_widget.py`
   - Lines 975-1061: Refactored wheelEvent handler
   - Lines 494-498: Added Qt event processing in _update_transform

## Technical Details

The fix ensures the mathematical invariant that for any zoom operation:
- Let P be a point at screen position S
- After zooming, P should remain at position S
- This is achieved by maintaining transform consistency throughout the operation

The transform pipeline:
```
data → flip_y → image_scale → main_scale → center_offset → pan_offset → screen
```

By using the same transform for both conversions and adjusting pan in a single step, we eliminate drift caused by transform inconsistency and floating-point accumulation.
