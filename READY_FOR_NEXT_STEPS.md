## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Days 1-2)
âœ… **Goal**: Get momentum, fix urgent issues
- Fix 40+ broken tests
- Set up CI/CD
- Update CLAUDE.md
- **Success Metric**: 400+ tests passing

### Phase 2: Sprint 10 (Days 3-7)
âœ… **Goal**: Integration & Stability
- Fix remaining integration tests
- Achieve 50% coverage
- Complete CI/CD automation
- **Success Metric**: 450+ tests passing, automated pipeline

### Phase 3: Reassess (Day 8)
âœ… **Goal**: Decide next steps
- If stable â†’ Sprint 11 (Performance)
- If tired â†’ Mini-sprints
- If done â†’ Maintenance mode

## Why This Order?

1. **Quick Wins First**
   - Builds momentum
   - Fixes blockers
   - Low effort, high impact
   - Can stop here if needed

2. **Sprint 10 Second**
   - Critical stability needed
   - Tests are blocking work
   - CI/CD prevents regression
   - Natural continuation

3. **Flexible Future**
   - Don't commit to Sprint 11 yet
   - See how Sprint 10 goes
   - Adjust based on needs
   - Maintain pragmatic approach

## Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /mnt/c/CustomScripts/Python/Work/Linux/CurveEditor

# 2. Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Check current test status
pytest tests/ --tb=no | tail -10

# 4. Start with first quick win
pytest tests/test_threading_safety.py::TestServiceThreadSafety -xvs

# 5. Fix the first failure you see
```
