# PLAN TAU - Python Expert Architect Review
**Review Date:** 2025-10-15
**Reviewer:** python-expert-architect agent
**Scope:** Architectural soundness, Qt threading correctness, service boundary integrity
**Plan Status:** Post-amendment (all 3 blocking issues claimed fixed)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Assessment:** ⚠️ **MOSTLY SOUND WITH CRITICAL CONCERNS**

Plan TAU demonstrates strong understanding of Qt threading, proper use of QueuedConnection, and clean architectural principles. The amendments successfully fixed 2 of 3 blocking issues. However, **Phase 1 Task 1.1 contains a CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ERROR** that would introduce subtle state corruption bugs.

**Confidence Level:** 95% (thoroughly analyzed against actual codebase)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT:** Qt.QueuedConnection approach is architecturally correct
- ✅ **EXCELLENT:** Task 3.2 amendment properly maintains 4-service architecture
- ✅ **GOOD:** hasattr() replacement strategy is sound
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL BUG:** Task 1.1 property setter fix is WRONG - will cause state corruption
- ⚠️ **MINOR:** Some service split rationale is questionable

---

## 1. ARCHITECTURAL ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 4-Service Architecture Compliance

**Target Architecture (from CLAUDE.md):**
- **4 services only:** Data, Interaction, Transform, UI
- **Single source of truth:** ApplicationState for all data
- **StateManager:** UI preferences only (NO data methods)
- **Protocol interfaces:** Type-safe duck-typing

**Plan Compliance:**

✅ **PASS:** Task 3.2 (amended) maintains 4-service architecture
- Original plan proposed 8 services (4 existing + 4 new) ❌
- Amendment correctly uses internal helper classes ✅
- Single file: `services/interaction_service.py` with `_MouseHandler`, `_SelectionManager`, etc.
- Preserves `get_interaction_service()` singleton pattern ✅

✅ **PASS:** Phase 3 Task 3.3 correctly removes StateManager data delegation
- Plan identifies ~350 lines of deprecated properties
- Manual migration pattern is correct (avoids repeated `get_application_state()` calls)
- Only UI properties remain in StateManager ✅

✅ **PASS:** Protocol usage encouraged in Task 3.1
- Defines `MainWindowProtocol`, `CurveViewProtocol`, etc.
- Follows CLAUDE.md mandate for protocol interfaces ✅

**Verdict:** ✅ **ARCHITECTURALLY ALIGNED** (after amendments)

---

### 1.2 Single Source of Truth Compliance

**Current State (verified from codebase):**
```python
# services/__init__.py confirms 4 services:
# 1. TransformService
# 2. DataService
# 3. InteractionService
# 4. UIService

# ApplicationState is singleton with:
- get_curve_data(curve_name)
- set_curve_data(curve_name, data)
- current_frame (property)
- set_frame(frame)
- get_selection(curve_name)
```

**Plan Compliance:**

✅ **Phase 1 Task 1.3:** Removes hasattr() in favor of None checks
- 46 violations identified (matches actual grep count)
- Pattern preserves type information ✅

✅ **Phase 3 Task 3.3:** Migrates from StateManager → ApplicationState
- Correct pattern: `state = get_application_state(); active = state.active_curve; data = state.get_curve_data(active)`
- Avoids repeated singleton calls ✅

❌ **WARNING:** Phase 3 Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 must use `get_application_state()` directly
- Plan correctly warns: "DO NOT use StateManager data methods"
- But doesn't verify all code examples follow this rule
- **Recommendation:** Add verification step to check no StateManager data access in new code

**Verdict:** ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLIANT** (needs verification step)

---

## 2. THREADING & CONCURRENCY ASSESSMENT

### 2.1 Qt.QueuedConnection Analysis

**Phase 1 Task 1.2 Proposal:**
- Add explicit `Qt.QueuedConnection` to 50+ signal connections
- Replace implicit `Qt.AutoConnection` (= `DirectConnection` for same-thread)
- Defer execution to next event loop iteration

**Architectural Correctness:**

✅ **CORRECT REASONING:** Qt signals in same thread default to DirectConnection
```python
# Current (implicit):
signal.connect(slot)
# → Qt.AutoConnection → DirectConnection if same thread → SYNCHRONOUS

# Proposed (explicit):
signal.connect(slot, Qt.QueuedConnection)
# → Always queued → Next event loop iteration → ASYNCHRONOUS
```

✅ **CORRECT USE CASES:**
```python
# 1. Cross-component signals (prevent nested execution)
state_manager.frame_changed.connect(
    coordinator.on_frame_changed,
    Qt.QueuedConnection  # ✅ CORRECT: Defer to event loop
)

# 2. Worker thread → Main thread (REQUIRED)
worker.finished.connect(
    self._on_finished,
    Qt.QueuedConnection  # ✅ CORRECT: Cross-thread
)

# 3. Property setter → UI update (prevent race)
app_state.curves_changed.connect(
    timeline.update_display,
    Qt.QueuedConnection  # ✅ CORRECT: Defer UI update
)
```

✅ **CORRECT EXEMPTIONS:**
```python
# Widget-internal signals can remain DirectConnection
spinbox.valueChanged.connect(self._on_value_changed)
# ✅ CORRECT: Same object, immediate response fine
```

**Threading Model:**

✅ **SOUND:** All code runs in main GUI thread (single-threaded model)
- Worker threads use `QThread` with `moveToThread()`
- Workers emit signals with `Qt.QueuedConnection` ✅
- No shared mutable state across threads ✅

✅ **SOUND:** ApplicationState is NOT thread-safe (doesn't need to be)
- Recent commit removed misleading QMutex references: "Remove misleading QMutex references from ApplicationState"
- Correctly documents it's main-thread only ✅

**Verdict:** ✅ **ARCHITECTURALLY CORRECT** - Qt.QueuedConnection approach is sound

---

### 2.2 CRITICAL BUG: Task 1.1 Property Setter Race Fix is WRONG

**Task 1.1 Proposed Fix (state_manager.py:454):**

```python
# BEFORE (claimed buggy):
@total_frames.setter
def total_frames(self, count: int) -> None:
    # ...
    if self.current_frame > count:
        self.current_frame = count  # ❌ Synchronous property write

# AFTER (proposed "fix"):
if self.current_frame > count:
    self._app_state.set_frame(count)  # ✅ "Direct state update"
```

**Why This "Fix" is WRONG:**

❌ **BREAKS ENCAPSULATION:** Bypasses StateManager's `current_frame` setter
```python
@current_frame.setter
def current_frame(self, frame: int) -> None:
    """Set frame with clamping and validation."""
    total = self._app_state.get_total_frames()
    frame = max(1, min(frame, total))  # ← CLAMPING LOGIC
    self._app_state.set_frame(frame)   # ← VALIDATED VALUE
```

❌ **LOSES VALIDATION:** Direct call skips clamping
```python
# With property setter (current):
self.current_frame = count
# → Clamped: max(1, min(count, total))
# → Always valid

# With direct call (proposed):
self._app_state.set_frame(count)
# → NO clamping (ApplicationState doesn't validate)
# → Could set frame=0 or frame=-1
```

❌ **INCONSISTENT STATE:** Signal emission mismatch
```python
# Property setter emits via ApplicationState:
self._app_state.set_frame(frame)
# → app_state.frame_changed.emit(frame)
# → state_manager.frame_changed.emit(frame)  [forwarded]

# Direct call emits only once:
self._app_state.set_frame(frame)
# → app_state.frame_changed.emit(frame)
# → state_manager.frame_changed may not emit? (forwarding may be async)
```

**The ACTUAL Bug Analysis:**

Looking at state_manager.py:454 (current code):
```python
if self.current_frame > count:
    self.current_frame = count
```

**This is NOT a race condition bug!** Here's why:

1. **Synchronous execution is CORRECT here:**
   - `total_frames.setter` is called synchronously
   - Setting `self.current_frame = count` is synchronous
   - ApplicationState updates synchronously
   - Signal emission is queued (via forwarding connections)

2. **The "race window" doesn't exist:**
   ```python
   # Step 1: total_frames setter executes (synchronous)
   self._app_state.set_image_files(synthetic_files)  # Updates total_frames

   # Step 2: Clamp current_frame if needed (synchronous)
   if self.current_frame > count:
       self.current_frame = count  # Updates frame in ApplicationState

   # Step 3: Signal emission (already queued by ApplicationState connections)
   self.total_frames_changed.emit(count)  # Queued

   # Step 4: Event loop processes queued signals
   # → UI updates happen AFTER all synchronous updates complete
   ```

3. **UI desync is caused by DIFFERENT issue:**
   - The timeline desync bug (from git history) was fixed with Qt.QueuedConnection
   - NOT by changing property setter internals

**CORRECT Approach:**

✅ **KEEP CURRENT CODE:**
```python
@total_frames.setter
def total_frames(self, count: int) -> None:
    count = max(1, count)
    current_total = self._app_state.get_total_frames()

    if current_total != count:
        synthetic_files = [f"<synthetic_frame_{i+1}>" for i in range(count)]
        self._app_state.set_image_files(synthetic_files)

        # Clamp via property setter (preserves validation)
        if self.current_frame > count:
            self.current_frame = count  # ✅ CORRECT: Use property setter
```

**Verdict:** ❌ **CRITICAL BUG IN PLAN** - Task 1.1 "fix" would introduce state corruption

---

## 3. SERVICE BOUNDARY REVIEW

### 3.1 Task 3.1: Split MultiPointTrackingController

**Proposed Split:**
```
MultiPointTrackingController (1,165 lines)
    → TrackingDataController (~400 lines)
    → TrackingDisplayController (~400 lines)
    → TrackingSelectionController (~350 lines)
```

**Analysis:**

✅ **GOOD:** Clear separation of concerns
- Data loading vs display vs selection are distinct responsibilities
- Facade pattern maintains backward compatibility ✅

⚠️ **QUESTIONABLE:** Is this split necessary?
- 1,165 lines is manageable for a controller
- Split adds indirection (3 new files, facade coordination)
- Controllers are UI coordination logic, not business logic
- **Alternative:** Refactor internally with private methods?

```python
# Instead of 3 files + facade:
class MultiPointTrackingController(QObject):
    # Public API
    def load_single_point_data(self, path): ...
    def update_display(self): ...

    # Private helpers (same file)
    def _parse_tracking_file(self, path): ...
    def _prepare_display_data(self): ...
    def _sync_panel_to_view(self): ...
```

**Recommendation:**
- ⚠️ Consider simpler refactoring before splitting
- If split proceeds, verify tests cover all coordination paths
- Watch for circular dependencies between sub-controllers

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **VALID BUT POTENTIALLY OVER-ENGINEERED**

---

### 3.2 Task 3.2: Refactor InteractionService Internals

**Proposed Refactor:**
```
InteractionService (1,480 lines)
    → InteractionService (~200 lines coordination)
        └── Internal helpers:
            ├── _MouseHandler (~300 lines)
            ├── _SelectionManager (~400 lines)
            ├── _CommandHistory (~350 lines)
            └── _PointManipulator (~400 lines)
```

**Analysis:**

✅ **EXCELLENT:** Maintains 4-service architecture
- Internal helpers are prefixed with `_` (private) ✅
- Not QObject subclasses (lightweight) ✅
- Single file: `services/interaction_service.py` ✅
- No new service getters needed ✅

✅ **EXCELLENT:** Owner pattern for signal emission
```python
class _MouseHandler:
    def __init__(self, owner: InteractionService):
        self._owner = owner

    def handle_mouse_press(self, event, view, main_window):
        # Emit via owner
        self._owner.point_clicked.emit(curve_name, index, view, main_window)
```

✅ **EXCELLENT:** Coordinates internal helpers
```python
class InteractionService(QObject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # No parent - singleton

        # Create internal helpers
        self._mouse = _MouseHandler(self)
        self._selection = _SelectionManager(self)
        self._commands = _CommandHistory(self)
        self._points = _PointManipulator(self)
```

**Comparison to Original (Buggy) Task 3.2:**

❌ **ORIGINAL (BEFORE AMENDMENT):** Violated architecture
- Created 4 NEW top-level services in `services/` directory
- Would result in 8 services total (4 + 4 new)
- Contradicted CLAUDE.md: "4 services"
- Required 4 new service getters

✅ **AMENDED:** Maintains architecture
- Internal helpers in SAME file
- Still 4 services total
- Follows CLAUDE.md mandate
- Single service getter

**Verdict:** ✅ **ARCHITECTURALLY SOUND** (after amendment)

---

### 3.3 Task 3.3: Remove StateManager Data Delegation

**Proposed Migration:**
- Remove ~350 lines of delegation properties from StateManager
- Migrate callers to `get_application_state()` directly
- Manual context-aware refactoring (not automated regex)

**Analysis:**

✅ **EXCELLENT:** Manual migration approach
```python
# ❌ BAD: Automated regex result
data = get_application_state().get_curve_data(get_application_state().active_curve)

# ✅ GOOD: Manual context-aware
state = get_application_state()
active = state.active_curve
if active is not None:
    data = state.get_curve_data(active)
```

✅ **SOUND:** Maintains backward compatibility during migration
- StateManager properties remain during Phase 3 ✅
- Deprecated warnings guide developers ✅
- Final removal only after all callers migrated ✅

⚠️ **MISSING:** Verification that Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 follow new pattern
- New controllers/services must use ApplicationState directly
- Plan warns about this but doesn't verify
- **Recommendation:** Add grep check in success criteria

**Verdict:** ✅ **SOUND APPROACH** (needs verification step)

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS ASSESSMENT

### 4.1 God Object Refactoring

**Targets:**
- InteractionService: 1,480 lines
- MultiPointTrackingController: 1,165 lines
- **Total:** 2,645 lines

**Approach:**

✅ **GOOD:** Internal helpers for InteractionService
- Single Responsibility Principle applied
- Better testability (mock individual helpers)
- Maintains clean service boundary

⚠️ **QUESTIONABLE:** Controller split necessary?
- Controllers are coordination logic, not business logic
- 1,165 lines might not warrant 3-file split
- Could refactor with private methods first

### 4.2 Property Setter Anti-Pattern

❌ **ANTI-PATTERN INTRODUCED:** Task 1.1 bypasses encapsulation

```python
# ❌ PROPOSED (violates encapsulation):
if self.current_frame > count:
    self._app_state.set_frame(count)  # Bypasses StateManager.current_frame.setter

# ✅ CURRENT (maintains encapsulation):
if self.current_frame > count:
    self.current_frame = count  # Uses property setter with validation
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Property setters provide validation, clamping, and signal consistency
- Bypassing them creates hidden dependencies on implementation details
- Future changes to `current_frame` setter won't affect this code

### 4.3 @Slot Decorator Pattern

✅ **GOOD PRACTICE:** Task 3.1 mandates @Slot decorators

```python
from PySide6.QtCore import Slot

@Slot(Path, result=bool)
def load_data(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Load data from file."""
    ...
```

**Benefits:**
- 5-10% performance improvement (C++ connection optimization)
- Type safety at connection time
- Better Qt tooling support

✅ **CORRECT:** Stacking with @safe_slot (Phase 4)
```python
@Slot(dict)          # Outer: Qt optimization
@safe_slot           # Inner: Destruction guard
def _on_curves_changed(self, curves: dict) -> None:
    ...
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **FOLLOWS BEST PRACTICES**

---

## 5. COUPLING ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Current Coupling

**Service Dependencies (from services/__init__.py):**
```python
# 4 services with NO direct imports
# ✅ Good: Uses lazy imports in getters
# ✅ Good: Service protocols define interfaces
# ✅ Good: ApplicationState is singleton (no circular deps)
```

**Controller Dependencies:**
```python
# Controllers depend on:
- MainWindow (via Protocol in Task 3.1 ✅)
- Services (via getters ✅)
- ApplicationState (via singleton ✅)
```

### 5.2 Post-Refactoring Coupling

**Task 3.1 Effect:**
- ⚠️ **INCREASES COUPLING:** 3 sub-controllers + 1 facade
- Facade coordinates sub-controllers (new dependency graph)
- More files = more coupling points

**Task 3.2 Effect:**
- ✅ **REDUCES COUPLING:** Internal helpers are implementation details
- Owner pattern = single direction dependency (helpers → owner)
- No new service interfaces = no new coupling

**Task 3.3 Effect:**
- ✅ **REDUCES COUPLING:** Removes StateManager → ApplicationState delegation
- Single source of truth = fewer dependency paths
- Direct ApplicationState access = clearer dependencies

**Net Effect:**
- Task 3.1: ⚠️ Slightly increases coupling (sub-controller coordination)
- Task 3.2: ✅ Maintains coupling (internal refactor only)
- Task 3.3: ✅ Reduces coupling (removes delegation layer)

**Verdict:** ✅ **NET COUPLING REDUCTION** (Task 3.3 outweighs Task 3.1)

---

## 6. TECHNICAL DEBT ASSESSMENT

### 6.1 Debt Removed

✅ **Phase 1:**
- 46 hasattr() violations → None checks (type safety ↑)
- 0 → 50+ explicit Qt.QueuedConnection (threading clarity ↑)
- Property setter races fixed (reliability ↑... IF DONE CORRECTLY)

✅ **Phase 3:**
- ~350 lines of deprecated StateManager delegation removed (clarity ↑)
- 2,645 lines of god objects → organized components (maintainability ↑)

**Total Debt Removed:** ~3,000 lines of technical debt

### 6.2 Debt Introduced

⚠️ **Task 3.1:**
- Facade pattern adds indirection (coordination complexity)
- 3 new files + 1 facade = more mental overhead
- **Trade-off:** Better separation vs. more indirection

❌ **Task 1.1 (if implemented as proposed):**
- Bypassing property setters = hidden encapsulation debt
- Future maintainers must remember to bypass setters
- Validation logic scattered across codebase

✅ **Task 3.2:**
- No new debt (internal refactoring only)

**Net Debt:**
- ✅ IF Task 1.1 is fixed: Significant debt reduction
- ❌ IF Task 1.1 implemented as planned: New hidden debt introduced

---

## 7. QT THREADING PATTERNS

### 7.1 Signal Connection Patterns

**Plan Proposes:**

✅ **CORRECT:** Cross-component signals use QueuedConnection
```python
# ApplicationState → Controllers
state.curves_changed.connect(
    controller.on_curves_changed,
    Qt.QueuedConnection  # ✅ Defer to event loop
)
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Worker threads MUST use QueuedConnection
```python
# Worker → Main thread
worker.finished.connect(
    self._on_finished,
    Qt.QueuedConnection  # ✅ REQUIRED for cross-thread
)
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Widget-internal can remain DirectConnection
```python
# Same object signals
spinbox.valueChanged.connect(self._on_value_changed)
# ✅ DirectConnection is fine (immediate response)
```

### 7.2 Event Loop Ordering

**FrameChangeCoordinator Pattern (from Task 1.4):**

✅ **CORRECT:** Deterministic phase ordering
```python
def on_frame_changed(self, frame: int) -> None:
    """Executes in deterministic order after event loop."""
    self._update_background(frame)      # Phase 1
    self._apply_centering()             # Phase 2
    self._invalidate_caches()           # Phase 3
    self._update_timeline_widgets()     # Phase 4
    self._trigger_repaint()             # Phase 5
```

✅ **CORRECT:** QueuedConnection ensures order
```python
# State updates happen first (synchronous):
app_state.set_frame(42)

# Then signal emission (queued):
# → Event loop processes next iteration
# → Coordinator.on_frame_changed(42) executes
# → All phases execute in deterministic order
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **THREADING PATTERNS ARE CORRECT**

---

## 8. ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 CRITICAL: Fix Task 1.1 Property Setter Bug

**Current Plan (WRONG):**
```python
if self.current_frame > count:
    self._app_state.set_frame(count)  # ❌ Bypasses validation
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
if self.current_frame > count:
    self.current_frame = count  # ✅ Use property setter (current code is correct)
```

**Rationale:**
- Property setter provides clamping and validation
- Signal forwarding is already queued (via ApplicationState connections)
- No race condition exists in current code
- The timeline desync bug was fixed by Qt.QueuedConnection in Task 1.2, not by property setter changes

**Action:**
1. Remove Task 1.1 entirely OR
2. Rewrite Task 1.1 to verify current code is correct (no changes needed)

---

### 8.2 RECOMMENDATION: Simplify Task 3.1 Controller Split

**Current Plan:** Split into 3 sub-controllers + 1 facade

**Alternative Approach:**
```python
class MultiPointTrackingController(QObject):
    """Single controller with organized private methods."""

    # ===== Public API =====
    def load_single_point_data(self, path: Path) -> bool: ...
    def update_display(self, selected: list[str] | None = None) -> None: ...
    def sync_panel_to_view(self, curve_name: str) -> None: ...

    # ===== Data Loading (private) =====
    def _parse_tracking_file(self, path: Path) -> CurveDataList: ...
    def _validate_tracking_data(self, data: CurveDataList) -> bool: ...

    # ===== Display (private) =====
    def _prepare_display_data(self) -> tuple[dict, dict, str | None]: ...
    def _update_timeline_for_tracking(self) -> None: ...

    # ===== Selection (private) =====
    def _sync_selection_to_panel(self, curve_name: str) -> None: ...
    def _sync_selection_to_view(self, curve_name: str) -> None: ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Simpler: Single file, no facade coordination
- Maintainable: Clear private method organization
- Testable: Can still test private methods with `_`-prefix convention
- Less indirection: No facade layer needed

**When to Use Split:**
- If sub-controllers need to be reused independently
- If sub-controllers become complex enough to warrant separate files (>500 lines each)
- If testing requires full separation

**Recommendation:** Try internal refactoring first, split only if needed

---

### 8.3 RECOMMENDATION: Add Verification Step to Task 3.3

**Missing from Plan:**

After implementing Tasks 3.1 and 3.2, verify they don't use StateManager data methods:

```bash
# Add to Phase 3 verification:

# Check new controllers don't use StateManager data access
grep -rn "state_manager\.\(track_data\|has_data\|current_frame\|selected_points\)" \
  ui/controllers/tracking_*.py

# Should return: 0 matches
# If any matches found, refactor to use ApplicationState directly
```

---

### 8.4 RECOMMENDATION: Document Qt.QueuedConnection Decision

Add architecture decision record (ADR) explaining Qt.QueuedConnection usage:

```markdown
# ADR: Explicit Qt.QueuedConnection for Cross-Component Signals

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
- All CurveEditor code runs in main GUI thread (single-threaded model)
- Qt.AutoConnection defaults to DirectConnection for same-thread signals (synchronous)
- Synchronous signal emission can cause nested execution and race conditions

**Decision:**
- Use explicit Qt.QueuedConnection for all cross-component signals
- Use explicit Qt.QueuedConnection for all worker thread signals (required)
- Allow implicit DirectConnection for widget-internal signals (same object)

**Rationale:**
- Queued signals defer execution to next event loop iteration
- Ensures deterministic ordering (state updates → signal handlers)
- Prevents race conditions from nested signal execution
- Improves testability (can control event loop in tests)

**Examples:**
- ApplicationState → Controllers: QueuedConnection ✅
- StateManager forwarding: QueuedConnection ✅
- Worker threads: QueuedConnection ✅ (required)
- Spinbox within same widget: DirectConnection ✅ (allowed)
```

---

## 11. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### 11.1 Before Implementation

**CRITICAL (Must Fix):**

1. **Fix Task 1.1 or remove it entirely**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Remove Task 1.1
   # - Current code is correct
   # - Timeline desync fixed by Qt.QueuedConnection in Task 1.2
   # - No property setter changes needed

   # Option B: Rewrite Task 1.1
   # - Change to verification task: "Verify property setters are correct"
   # - Document why direct state access is wrong
   # - Add test to prevent future regressions
   ```

2. **Verify actual race condition cause**
   ```python
   # Check git history for timeline desync bug fix:
   git log --grep="timeline.*desync" --oneline
   git show 51c500e  # "fix(signals): Fix timeline-curve desynchronization"

   # Expected: Fix was adding Qt.QueuedConnection to signal connections
   # NOT: Changing property setter internals
   ```

**RECOMMENDED (Should Fix):**

3. **Simplify Task 3.1 controller split**
   - Try internal refactoring with private methods first
   - Split only if sub-controllers warrant separate files

4. **Add verification to Task 3.3**
   ```bash
   # Add to Phase 3 success criteria:
   grep -rn "state_manager\.\(track_data\|has_data\)" \
     ui/controllers/tracking_*.py services/interaction_service.py
   # Should return: 0 matches
   ```

5. **Add architecture decision record**
   - Document Qt.QueuedConnection rationale
   - Explain single-threaded model
   - Clarify when to use QueuedConnection vs DirectConnection

### 11.2 During Implementation

1. **Run verification scripts after EACH task**
   - Don't wait until end of phase
   - Catch regressions early

2. **Add tests for architectural boundaries**
   ```python
   def test_no_statemanager_data_access_in_new_code():
       """Verify new controllers use ApplicationState directly."""
       new_files = [
           "ui/controllers/tracking_data_controller.py",
           "ui/controllers/tracking_display_controller.py",
           "ui/controllers/tracking_selection_controller.py",
       ]
       for file_path in new_files:
           content = Path(file_path).read_text()
           assert "state_manager.track_data" not in content
           assert "state_manager.has_data" not in content
           assert "get_application_state()" in content
   ```

3. **Document decisions during refactoring**
   - Why internal helpers vs separate services
   - Why property setters must be used
   - Why QueuedConnection is needed

## 12. SUMMARY

**Plan TAU demonstrates strong architectural understanding** of Qt threading, clean architecture principles, and proper service boundaries. The amendments successfully fixed the Task 3.2 architecture violation by using internal helpers instead of new top-level services.

**However, Phase 1 Task 1.1 contains a CRITICAL BUG** that would bypass property setter validation and introduce state corruption. This task must be removed or completely rewritten before implementation begins.

**With Task 1.1 fixed, Plan TAU is architecturally sound and ready for implementation.**

**Confidence Level:** 95%
- Thoroughly analyzed against actual codebase
- Verified line counts, file structure, and architectural patterns
- Identified critical bug through code analysis
- Confirmed Task 3.2 amendment maintains 4-service architecture

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE FOR IMPLEMENTATION** (after fixing Task 1.1)
