**Last Updated**: Sprint 11 Day 5 (August 2025)
**Version**: 11.0.0

---

## Issue Severity Levels

- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: Blocks core functionality or causes data loss
- **ðŸŸ  HIGH**: Significant impact on user experience
- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Noticeable but has workaround
- **ðŸŸ¢ LOW**: Minor/cosmetic issue
- **ðŸ”µ INFO**: Known limitation or environment-specific

---

## Current Issues

### ðŸ”µ INFO - Test Suite Segmentation Faults in WSL2

**Severity**: INFO (Application works correctly)
**Component**: Test Suite
**Environment**: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**Description**:
- pytest crashes with segmentation faults when running certain tests
- Particularly affects tests that create MainWindow or use Qt components
- Application itself runs without issues

**Workaround**:
- Run application directly: `python main.py`
- Use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` for headless testing
- Test on native Linux or macOS for full test suite

**Status**: Won't fix (WSL-specific Qt issue)

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Missing SVG Icon Resources

**Severity**: LOW (Cosmetic only)
**Component**: UI Resources

**Description**:
- Console warnings: "Cannot open file ':/icons/check-white.svg'"
- Missing icon files in resource system
- Does not affect functionality

**Impact**:
- Minor console warnings on startup
- Some UI elements may show placeholder icons

**Fix**: Add SVG resources or remove icon references

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW - QPropertyAnimation Warnings

**Severity**: LOW (Cosmetic)
**Component**: UI Animations

**Description**:
- Warning: "QPropertyAnimation::updateState (opacity): Changing state of an animation without target"
- Occurs during UI transitions

**Impact**:
- Console warning only
- Animations still function correctly

**Fix**: Set animation targets properly in ModernizedMainWindow

---

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - Code Quality Issues

**Severity**: MEDIUM (Technical debt)
**Component**: Codebase

**Statistics**:
- 1056 ruff linting issues (mostly formatting)
- 1217 basedpyright type checking warnings
- Most are PySide6 stub-related

**Impact**:
- No functional impact
- Makes development slightly harder
- May hide real issues

**Mitigation**:
- Critical issues have been addressed
- Remaining are mostly cosmetic
- Can be fixed incrementally

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Sample Data Files Missing

**Severity**: LOW
**Component**: Data Files

**Description**:
- No sample CSV/image files in data directory
- Tests expect burger-001.csv and Burger.001.png

**Impact**:
- Some tests fail due to missing data
- New users have no sample files to test with

**Fix**: Add sample data files to repository

---

### ðŸ”µ INFO - Dual Architecture Naming Confusion

**Severity**: INFO (Documentation issue)
**Component**: Architecture

**Description**:
- `USE_NEW_SERVICES=true` actually enables OLD Sprint 8 services
- `USE_NEW_SERVICES=false` (default) uses NEW consolidated services
- Historical naming artifact

**Impact**:
- Confusing for developers
- No functional impact

**Mitigation**:
- Documented in CLAUDE.md and DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- Consider renaming in future release

---

## Fixed Issues (Sprint 11)

### âœ… FIXED - Background/Curve Zoom Synchronization
- **Previous**: Background and curves moved independently
- **Fixed**: Sprint 11 Day 3
- **Solution**: Unified transform pipeline

### âœ… FIXED - Memory Leaks in Animations
- **Previous**: Animations leaked memory over time
- **Fixed**: Sprint 11 Day 2
- **Solution**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### âœ… FIXED - Service Crashes
- **Previous**: SelectionService and PointManipulationService crashes
- **Fixed**: Sprint 11 Day 2
- **Solution**: Service consolidation and proper initialization

### âœ… FIXED - Thread Safety Issues
- **Previous**: Spatial index race conditions
- **Fixed**: Sprint 11 Day 2
- **Solution**: Added thread locks

### âœ… FIXED - Missing Methods in Services
- **Previous**: analyze_points, create_transform missing
- **Fixed**: Sprint 11 Day 3
- **Solution**: Added required methods

## Risk Assessment

### Production Deployment Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Large dataset performance | Low | Medium | Spatial indexing handles 10K+ points |
| Cross-platform issues | Medium | Low | Qt6 handles most differences |
| Memory usage spike | Low | Medium | Monitoring recommended |
| File corruption | Very Low | High | Backup before save operations |

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. âœ… None required - application is production ready

### Short-term (Post-deployment)
1. Add sample data files
2. Fix SVG icon warnings
3. Document animation target fix

### Long-term (Future Sprints)
1. Address linting issues incrementally
2. Add PySide6 type stubs
3. Rename USE_NEW_SERVICES flag
4. Improve WSL test compatibility
